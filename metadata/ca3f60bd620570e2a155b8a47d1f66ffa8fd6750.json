Ralph is a mysterious artist. Although his music is great, his songs recieve little to no recognition(with the exception of &quot;Kansas City Shuffle&quot; on the soundtrack for Lucky Number Slevin), and it&amp;#039;s hard to come by his albums. Here is the amazing Music to Mauzner by, which he released under the alias &quot;Spy&quot;. \n\nThe songs are ripped from his streaming webpage, so it&amp;#039;s more of a convenience thing than theft. 224 kbps. ID tags fixed. Enjoy! I&amp;#039;ll try to get more J. Ralph up soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca3f60bd620570e2a155b8a47d1f66ffa8fd6750","amp;dn":"J.+Ralph+-+Music+to+Mauzner+by+-+Rare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca3f60bd620570e2a155b8a47d1f66ffa8fd6750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,63,96,189,98,5,112,226,161,85,184,164,125,31,102,255,168,253,103,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
