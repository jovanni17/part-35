In his second book, Fidgen presents more hand-tool woodworking projects for the home and workshop. The projects have a distinctive retro look, recycling designs from our not-so-distant past: He has reconceived the classic library card catalogue (converted to use for kitchen storage); his clever medicine chest does double duty as a four-bottle wine tote; and his gentlemans valet is an elegant clothing stand with a profile that harks back to the days of high style and quality wares. In the opening chapters, Fidgen discusses the benefits of working in an unplugged woodshop, considers the sources of design inspiration, offers advice on glues and finishes, and even explains how to make hand tools using only hand tools.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56bf2ef4c45a85729bcefc219094132b5c49a47f","amp;dn":"Workbook+for+MacDonald%27s+Woodworking+%2B+The+Unplugged+Woodshop%3A+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56bf2ef4c45a85729bcefc219094132b5c49a47f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,191,46,244,196,90,133,114,155,206,252,33,144,148,19,43,92,73,164,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
