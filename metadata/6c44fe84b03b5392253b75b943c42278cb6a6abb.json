It was a huge hit in Germany, spending 21 weeks in the Top Ten and also reached the Top Fifty in the U.S., Canada and the UK.\n\nThe album Hawaii Tattoo reached the number 93 spot in the Billboard Hot 200 in 1965.\n\nBehind the scenes, record producer Horst Fuchs promoted the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career and pulled the strings. Composers such as Jo van Wetter, Willy Albimoor, Hans Blum and Michael Thomas (the famous Martin BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ttcher) created songs like &quot;Hawaii Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Carnival of Venice&quot;, &quot;Mein Hut der hat drei Ecken&quot;, &quot;Aloha Parade&quot;, &quot;Honolulu Parade&quot; and &quot;Waikiki Welcome&quot;. The Waikikis sold their colorful island reveries by the millions and some of their own creations like &quot;Hilo Kiss&quot; or &quot;Hula-Hochzeit&quot; (&quot;Hawaii Honeymoon&quot;) even made their way into the charts in several countries.\n\nIn 2004 the song &quot;Hawaiian March&quot; was used for the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Prince Paul's Bubble PartyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ track on the SpongeBob SquarePants Movie film soundtrack. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waikikis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waikikis&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklist:\n01.
