Contains tracks from &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; and the soundtrack to &quot;The Great Rock 'N' Roll Swindle&quot;.  Not really essential for that EXCEPT that it contains two tracks not found on either album.  These are &quot;No Fun&quot; and &quot;Did You No Wrong.&quot;  That alone is worth the price of admission.\n\n  \n\nTrack Listing\n\n\n   1. &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; (Rotten, Jones, Matlock, Cook) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n   2. &quot;I Wanna Be Me&quot; (Rotten, Jones, Matlock, Cook) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n   3. &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (Rotten, Jones, Matlock, Cook) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n   4. &quot;Did You No Wrong&quot; (Rotten, Jones, Matlock, Cook, W.

It's not really the best way to hear those singles, though -- there was a sharp decline in the quality and relevance of the Pistols' material when Johnny Rotten left the band, and some of the later goofiness dilutes the impact of early songs like &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; It is a useful compilation in that two songs -- &quot;Did You No Wrong&quot; and &quot;No Fun&quot; -- are unavailable on both Never Mind the Bollocks and The Great Rock &amp; Roll Swindle, and it is perfect for fans who don't want to sift through the latter and will be content with a brief overview. Still, Dead Horse doesn't match Never Mind the Bollocks (still the necessary purchase) for start-to-finish venom, and as inconsistent as Swindle is, it can be quite entertaining. So, Flogging a Dead Horse is not the best compilation, but it will do in some cases.\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview\n\nby Steve Huey\n\nFlogging a Dead Horse collects the A- and B-sides of the Sex Pistols' seven British singles.
