In this brilliant new study, Carol Newsom illuminates the relation between the aesthetic forms of the book and the claims made by its various characters. Her innovative approach makes possible a new understanding of the unity of the book of Job; she rejects the dismantling of the book by historical criticism and the flattening of the text that characterizes certain final form readings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345aa8b55fd8784aec8b0a8b0deac4994aaede01","amp;dn":"Carol+A+Newsom+-+The+Book+of+Job+%282009%29+%5Bpdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345aa8b55fd8784aec8b0a8b0deac4994aaede01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,90,168,181,95,216,120,74,236,139,10,139,13,234,196,153,74,174,222,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
