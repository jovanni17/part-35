Another Song About The Weekend (Acoustic)\n\n  Ocala, FL-based post-hardcore outfit A Day to Remember's third full-length offering opens with the blistering &quot;The Downfall of Us All,&quot; a hugely melodic slice of metal-infused punk-pop bliss that's sure to land a second life in countless montages on MTV reality shows and 30-second cola commercials. What follows is a collection of perfectly executed and fairly standard clean vocal post-hardcore emo-pop that both revels in and illuminates the limitations of the genre. While lead singer Jeremy McKinnon fulfills his duty as a clean/screamo switch-hitter throughout Homesick, the incessant group vocals provide the thread from which the album was designed. Exciting at first, the constant &quot;yeahs&quot; and &quot;heys&quot; eventually dissolve into the waves of distortion mid-album, resulting in the audio equivalent of an energy drink crash. The band does its best to juggle both worlds on the pretty, simplistic, and anthemic &quot;Have Faith in Me,&quot; and closer &quot;If It Means a Lot to You&quot; provides fans with a fine Bic lighter/cell phone light moment, but there's just not enough here to separate it from the deafening, ultimately forgettable, over-compressed slabs of twentysomething angst that came before it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac6a1fa505a20da1cbc60eb418901b7f851cb8b0","amp;dn":"A+Day+to+Remember+-+Homesick+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac6a1fa505a20da1cbc60eb418901b7f851cb8b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,106,31,165,5,162,13,161,203,198,14,180,24,144,27,127,133,28,184,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
