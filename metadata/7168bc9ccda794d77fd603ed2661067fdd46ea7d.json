This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nOne song in this countdown is by an act who holds the all time record for hitting the top 40 with the most lead singers.\nCasey tells the story of the song that holds the all time record for most weeks at number one. It was written by a convict serving time for attempted murder.\n\n40:    Wake Up (Next To You) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Graham Parker and The Shot\n39:    What About Love - Heart\n38:    You Spin Me Around (Like A Record) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dead or Alive        \n37:    Little By Little Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Robert Plant     \n36:    Never Ending Story - Limahl     \n35:    Shout Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tears For Fears    \n34:    Never Surrender Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Corey Hart\n33:    WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Holding Donna Now - Debarge\nLdd: Solid Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ashford &amp; Simpson\n32:    People Are People Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Depeche Mode\n31:    Possession Obsession Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n30:    Bang A Gong (Get It On) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Power Station\n29:    Cannonball - Supertramp    \n28:    Just As I Am Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Air Supply\n27:    19 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Hardcastle\n26:    Getcha Back Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Beach Boys\n25:    Fresh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kool &amp; The Gang\n24:    Axel F Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harold Faltermeyer\n23:    Tough All Over Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Cafferty &amp; The Beaver Brown Band\n22:    Crazy In The Night (Barking At Airplanes) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kim Carnes\n21:    Everything She Wants - Wham\n20:    Sentimental Street Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Night Ranger\n19:    If You Love Somebody Set Them Free Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sting\n18:    Suddenly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billy Ocean\n17:    Glory Days Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bruce Springsteen\n16:    SmugglerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blues Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Glenn Frey\n15:    The Goonies Ã¢â‚¬ËœRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Good Tonight Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cyndi Lauper\n14:    Everytime You Go Away Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Young\n13:    You Give Good Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Whitney Houston\n12:    Voices Carry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœTil Tuesday\n11:    Walking On Sunshine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Katrina And The Waves\n10:    In My House Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mary Jane Girls\n9:    Things Can Only Get Better Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Howard Jones\n8:    Would I Lie To You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Eurythmics\nLdd: LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hear It For The Boy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Deniece Williams\n7:    Everybody Wants To Rule The World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tears For Fears\n6:    The Search Is Over - Survivor\n5:    Angel - Madonna\n4:    Raspberry Berret Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Prince And The Revolution\n3:    A View To A Kill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Duran Duran\n2:    Sussudio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Phil Collins\n1:    Heaven Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bryan Adams\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7168bc9ccda794d77fd603ed2661067fdd46ea7d","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_June_29th%2C_1985","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7168bc9ccda794d77fd603ed2661067fdd46ea7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,104,188,156,205,167,148,215,127,214,3,237,38,97,6,127,221,70,234,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
