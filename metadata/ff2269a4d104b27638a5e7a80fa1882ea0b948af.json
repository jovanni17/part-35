At about the same time, a single &quot;Indian Summer&quot; reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. The North American version of The House on the Hill on Elektra Records added &quot;Indian Summer&quot; as the opening track, along with &quot;It Brings A Tear&quot; which had already appeared on the UK album Friend's Friend's Friend. The Elektra LP dropped the song &quot;Eye To Eye&quot;.\n\nBoth the UK and North American LPs were originally issued as gatefold. The UK gatefold contains black-and-white photos of each band member. The Elektra Records gatefold contains the album lyrics with a photo of the &quot;house on the hill&quot; in the background. The Elektra LP was later reissued in the early 1980s, non-gatefold.\n\nThe 1991 Virgin Records UK CD release, issued in the U.S. on Caroline Records, used the UK. LP track listing, adding the single &quot;Indian Summer&quot; to the end of the album. The Elektra Records version of The House On The Hill has never been issued on CD.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff2269a4d104b27638a5e7a80fa1882ea0b948af","amp;dn":"Audience+-+The+House+On+The+Hill+%5B1971%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff2269a4d104b27638a5e7a80fa1882ea0b948af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,34,105,164,209,4,178,118,56,165,231,168,15,161,136,46,160,185,72,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
