Thousands of citizens are making desperate runs on ATMs to get as much money as possible before they lose a big chunk to the global Mafia. The outrageous move will undoubtedly accelerate the economic crisis in Europe as markets adjust accordingly and depositors in Spain, Italy and Greece make bank runs to protect their devalued currencies from criminal expropriation. \n\nAlex also gets into the remarkable exchange between senators Ted Cruz and Dianne Feinstein on proposed gun legislation and the latest effort by the United Nations to force through its gun-grabber treaty.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
