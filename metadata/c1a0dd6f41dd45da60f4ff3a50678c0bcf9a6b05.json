The Other is one of these. Adapted by Thomas Tryon from his novel and \ndirected by Robert Mulligan, The Other is a dark, eerie minor masterpiece that \nis filled with lasting images: a finger wrapped up in a handkerchief, a boy \nleaping into a pile of hay with a pitchfork in it, the corpse of a baby drowned \nin a wine barrel. The film focuses on twin brothers living on a New England farm \nin 1935. Peeling away in layers, the tale reveals a family fraught with tragic \naccidents that don&amp;#039;t appear so accidental. Tryon&amp;#039;s three-act script nicely \nbuilds up the suspense revealing the evil that resides within one of the boys. \nHowever, a disturbing twist at the close of the second act abruptly shifts the \ndirection of the plot and sends the film into a frightening spiral in which all \nof the truths are finally exposed. As he did with Summer of &amp;#039;42, director \nMulligan perfectly captures the time period as well as the essence of childhood. \nYoung stars Chris Udvarnoky and Martin Udvarnoky do an excellent job playing \nthese devious children, but it is Uta Hagen who steals the show as their \nall-knowing grandmother. Jerry Goldsmith&amp;#039;s score is purposely low-key and in \nkeeping with the picture&amp;#039;s ominous, downbeat tone. The network television \nversion added a voice-over to the film&amp;#039;s final shot. \n\n(Patrick Legare, Allmovie)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is a summer when bad luck just seems to come in waves. Maybe they should have \ntaken warning last spring, when Father was killed by a trapdoor that fell on him \nin the barn. Now things are really getting bad. Mother has been paralyzed in a \nfall down the stairs, and Marshall landed on a pitchfork in the hay, and Aunt \nVee must have had a heart attack or something and her body wasn&amp;#039;t found for \ndays. And the baby . . .\n\nWell, it&amp;#039;s like they say. Things gotta get worse before they get any better. \nNiles, a chubby little boy with the face of an angel, plays around the farm and \ntries to stay out of trouble. Somehow, he&amp;#039;s the only one who never gets \nparalyzed or skewered or anything. But he has his own cross to bear: His twin \nbrother Holland departed this earth some months ago after a strange illness.\n\nWell, maybe Holland departed and maybe he didn&amp;#039;t. Everyone else in the family is \nunder the impression that Holland is dead and buried, but Niles sees him clear \nas day, and talks with him, and they play together out in the woods. Holland \nkeeps getting Niles in trouble. And when Niles gets in trouble, everybody&amp;#039;s in \ntrouble. Just ask Father, or Mother, or Russell, or Aunt Vee. Or the baby . . .\n\nRobert Mulligan&amp;#039;s &quot;The Other&quot; is a movie that is maybe about the supernatural \nand maybe not. It all depends on whether Niles is schizo, or whether Holland \nreally has returned from the dead, possessed his twin brother&amp;#039;s soul, and is \nstage-managing the troubles. My notion is that Niles is cuckoo. But Mulligan \nplays, a cagey game with his camera, always showing us Holland from Niles point \nof view, but never showing us Niles as Holland would see him (if Holland were \nthere). Also, nobody else sees Holland.\n\nMulligan, whose last film was &quot;Summer of &amp;#039;42&quot; and who gave us another nostalgic \nportrait of the past in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; places his film in the rural \n1930s. It is a time of drowsy summers and half-remembered baseball scores, and a \ntime for a boy when everything is bigger than life, and scarier. Mulligan also \nhas given the movie a weird Gothic feel and populated it with grotesques.\n\nNiles goes into town to the circus, for example, and sneaks into the freak show. \nAll of the people inside look evil and menacing and seductively unhealthy. Niles \ndecides to hold his own little magic show. At the real sideshow, the magician&amp;#039;s \nassistant slipped out of the trunk by dropping through a trapdoor, just before \nthe magician stuck the swords into the trunk. That can put ideas in the head of \na young lad with imagination. There&amp;#039;s that trapdoor in the barn, for example - \nthe one that killed Father. And although there isn&amp;#039;t any magician&amp;#039;s assistant \nhandy to disappear, there is always the baby . . .\n\n&quot;The Other,&quot; which is based on the novel by former actor Tom Tryon (you saw him \nas &quot;The Cardinal&quot;), has been criticized in some quarters because Mulligan made \nit too beautiful, they say, and too nostalgic. Not at all. His colors are rich \nand deep and dark, chocolatey browns and bloody reds; they aren&amp;#039;t beautiful but \nperverse and menacing. And the farm isn&amp;#039;t seen with a warm nostalgia, but with a \nremembrance that it is haunted. The movie isn&amp;#039;t scary in the usual horror-film \nway, but because Niles is such a creep - the kind of kid who would pull the \nwings off a fly and then claim the big boys made him (and get them in trouble, \nand go out looking for more flies). Kids like that will stop at nothing.\n\n(Roger Ebert / July 6, 1972)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI remember seeing The Other when it was first released in 1972 and being \ndisturbed by the general concept and haunted by a couple of images (that I can&amp;#039;t \nreveal, lest it give away too much). Similar to Freaks (even including a brief \nscene at a carnival freak show) the film has elements of horror, but overall \nit&amp;#039;s hard to classify under strictly one genreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½many parts are rather pastoral, \nothers have elements of a thriller, yet the overall effect remains one of \nhorror.\n\nMuch of The Other revolves around a few plot twists and devices, so I&amp;#039;ll avoid \nspoiling key information.\n\nAfter starring in minor parts in numerous Hollywood films (The Longest Day, The \nCardinal and 18 others) Tom Tryon produced and wrote this disturbing tale, set \nin the New England countryside in 1935. The film opens in the woods on a pensive \nyoung boy named Niles, who has an identical twin brother named Holland. The \ntwins may look alike, but their personalities are completely differentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Niles is \nthe shy, introspective nice child while Holland is the outgoing naughty one.\n\nIt seems that the camera is doing elementary tricks on us at the beginning when \nit never shows the twins in one frame together. So it appears that they are \nusing the same kid for both twins until the credits reveal that identical twins \nChristopher and Martin Udvarnoky were cast as Niles and Holland respectively. \nUsing inexperienced child actors to carry the movie has drawbacks (this will be \nthe boys&amp;#039; only film), but the two perform adequately enough. In fact, they act \nlike . . . kids, who alternate between being innocent, playful, and crude. Even \nmore professional child actors wouldn&amp;#039;t be able to reveal much more character \nthan the Udvamoky twins since the script is mostly interested in the boys as \nplot devises. Creating the overall ominous atmosphere is far more important than \nany potential character study.\n\nThe most developed character is the grandmother many of us would love to \nhaveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ada (Uta Hagen), who is especially close to Niles. She has taught him &quot;The \nGame,&quot; akin to the way the mythological Merlin instructed King Arthur by \nteaching him how &quot;get inside&quot; other creatures to see their point of view, best \nillustrated with the scene where Niles sees the area from a crow&amp;#039;s eye view. The \nsoaring camerawork here is very effective. After this sequence, we understand \nwhat the boys mean by playing &quot;The Game&quot; in other circumstances.\n\nFrom pre-screening clues on the video box and by its usual classification in the \nhorror section, some creepy things are anticipated and director Robert Mulligan \ndoesn&amp;#039;t disappointÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½he builds suspense gradually (some will think far too \nslowly), and he&amp;#039;ll throw out a number of red herrings. You may be able to guess \n&quot;some&quot; of the secret that the movie tag line &quot;Please Don&amp;#039;t Reveal the Secret of \nThe Other&quot; refers to, but you&amp;#039;ll be hard pressed to guess all of it. Jerry \nGoldsmith&amp;#039;s haunting score helps measurablyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it&amp;#039;s memorable, but not overused.\n\nDespite its age, the film still holds up fairly well but would flop as a new \nrelease in today&amp;#039;s film climate. Certain scenes would be shot differently today \nto show a lot more blood and gore. I&amp;#039;d love to see what Argento could do with \nthis psychological horror/thriller, given his track record with Phenomena and \nDeep Red. Instead, viewers will see glimpses of various accidents (or are they?) \nand will anticipate the coming gore scenes, only to have the camera switch \nelsewhere. While Hitchcock proved that such a technique can work magnificently, \nMulligan is no match for the master. The Other is a competent flick that will \nprove to be a lot freakier for film fans with active imaginations.\n\nUnfortunately, the film came onto the scene a few years too early and was \nquickly buried by the superior Halloween and other teen slasher films that \nplayed off Halloween&amp;#039;s success. The Other is now out of print and largely \nforgotten, perhaps still stored on some dusty rental shelves or sold on a few \nonline auction sites. I don&amp;#039;t anticipate this relatively low budget flick to be \nrevived, unless someone can obtain the rights for a remake. But it&amp;#039;s certainly \nworth a rental if you can get hold of a copyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it was good enough to pop back into \nmemory when I was trying to think of an overlooked horror film, and there&amp;#039;s \ncertainly a lot bloodier flicks that have long ago been erased from memory.\n\n(John Nesbit, Old School Reviews)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 PLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck you have installed the right codecs, as listed in this .nfo file, before\ntrying to play it.
