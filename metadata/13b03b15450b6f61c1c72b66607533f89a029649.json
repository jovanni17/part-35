Featuring new interviews with series creator Robert Kirkman and executive producer Frank Darabont, as well as the cast and crew, the book also includes sidebars that serve as a detailed episode guide, reproducing excerpts from early drafts and final scripts, and revealing new direcÃ‚Â­tions for the second season and beyond.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - The Walking Dead [Graphic Novels] + Extras:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8618344&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8618344&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - State of Decay OST (2013) - Jesper Kyd:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13b03b15450b6f61c1c72b66607533f89a029649","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Chronicles%3A+The+Official+Companion+Book+%5B2011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13b03b15450b6f61c1c72b66607533f89a029649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,176,59,21,69,11,111,97,193,199,43,102,96,117,51,248,154,2,150,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
