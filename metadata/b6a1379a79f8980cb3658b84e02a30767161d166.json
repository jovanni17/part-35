I&amp;#039;ve been searching my ass off to find this album online (without having to pay for it,I already own it on a vinyl record...support Hip-Hop!! Support vinyl!!) and since it is so hard to find, I thougt I would share it with hip-hop heads world wide...\nFor those of you who haven&amp;#039;t heard of this album, it is Cage &amp; Camu Tao together as a group called Nighthawks....gooooood shit,download and enjoy,then buy the record!\n\n...:leave some comments if you like,i have more great hip-hop albums:...\n\n       - It&amp;#039;s like i hate drug dealers,but i love to chase drugs -\n                               \n                              Ballrogg2000\n\n\nReview:\n\n&quot;Now this is one big trip. Based on the Sylvester Stallone shelf-stocker flick of the same name, Night Hawks lands Agents DaSilva and Fox (Cage and Camu Tao of MHz, respectively) in hot pursuit of international terrorist &quot;Wulfgar.&quot; Okay ? that?s what it says in the introduction, but there really isn?t much of a storyline after that. Instead, what you get is a matted glance &quot;into the minds and careers of rogue undercovers,&quot; touching upon virtually every sort of bad-cop archetype that you can imagine.\n\nFrom the obligatory &quot;Car Chase&quot; to the surreal yet clever &quot;Count Crackula,&quot; where the drug scene is likened to a sort of blood game with vampires as dealers, Night Hawks delivers where most gimmick projects fail. Musically, the focus is mainly on enhancing mood and setting, so don?t expect the usual array of Mighty Mi slammers. But in a year full of nondescript long-players, the Hawks? themed approach is unusually refreshing. &quot; URB MAGAZINE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a1379a79f8980cb3658b84e02a30767161d166","amp;dn":"Nighthawks+-+Nighthawks+%28Cage+%26+Camu+Tao%29+Full+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a1379a79f8980cb3658b84e02a30767161d166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,161,55,154,121,248,152,12,179,101,139,132,224,42,48,118,113,97,209,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
