But as risk expert Gerd Gigerenzer shows, the surprising truth is that in the real world, we often get better results by using simple rules and considering less information.\n\n In Risk Savvy, Gigerenzer reveals that most of us, including doctors, lawyers, financial advisers, and elected officials, misunderstand statistics much more often than we think, leaving us not only misinformed, but vulnerable to exploitation. Yet there is hope. Anyone can learn to make better decisions for their health, finances, family, and business without needing to consult an expert or a super computer, and Gigerenzer shows us how.\n\n Risk Savvy is an insightful and easy-to-understand remedy to our collective information overload and an essential guide to making smart, confident decisions in the face of uncertainty. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49d33cf3b611b9f1063f12f96cfafc5d9382ee2c","amp;dn":"Risk+Savvy%3A+How+to+Make+Good+Decisions+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49d33cf3b611b9f1063f12f96cfafc5d9382ee2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,211,60,243,182,17,185,241,6,63,18,249,108,250,252,93,147,130,238,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
