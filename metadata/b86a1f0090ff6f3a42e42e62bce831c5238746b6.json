In addition to examining evidence for sociocultural influences on body image, the book also reviews recent literature and includes new findings on body modification practices (cosmetic surgery, piercing, tattooing, and bodybuilding). It takes a critical look at interventions designed to promote positive body image and also attempts to link body image to physical health, looking in particular at motivations for potentially health-damaging practices such as anabolic steroid use and cosmetic surgery. \n\nThe only text to date that examines the issue of body image, focusing on men and children as well as women, Body Image will be invaluable to students and researchers in the area as well as those with an interest in how to promote positive body image........................................\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b86a1f0090ff6f3a42e42e62bce831c5238746b6","amp;dn":"Body+Image+-+Understanding+Body+Dissatisfaction+in+Men%2C+Women%2C+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b86a1f0090ff6f3a42e42e62bce831c5238746b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,106,31,0,144,255,111,58,66,228,46,98,188,232,49,197,35,135,70,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
