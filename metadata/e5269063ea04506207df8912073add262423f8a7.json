Like Jimmie Rodgers, Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Townes Van Zandt was the embodiment of that mythic American figure, the troubled troubadour. \n\nA Deeper Blue traces Van Zandt's background as the scion of a prominent Texas family; his troubled early years and his transformation from promising preÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlaw student to wandering folk singer; his life on the road and the demons that pursued and were pursued by him; the women who loved and inspired him; and the brilliance and enduring beauty of his songs,which are explored in depth. \n\nThe author draws on eight years' extensive research and interviews with Townes' family and closest friends and colleagues. He looks beyond the legend and paints a colorful portrait of a complex man who embraced the darkness of demons and myth as well as the light of deep compassion and humanity, all &quot;for the sake of the song.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5269063ea04506207df8912073add262423f8a7","amp;dn":"A+Deeper+Blue-The+Life+and+Music+of+Townes+Van+Zandt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5269063ea04506207df8912073add262423f8a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,38,144,99,234,4,80,98,7,223,137,18,7,58,221,38,36,35,248,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
