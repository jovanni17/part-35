Based on the line as it appeared between 2000 and the present day, this expansion pack includes the Class 450 electric multiple unit (a very familiar sight on the line) and faithful representations of all 16 stations along the route. The Portsmouth Direct Line runs through busy urban centres, suburbs and rural areas as it makes its way from Woking in Surrey across the North and South Downs to the historic naval town of Portsmouth on the South Coast.\n\nThe line was first begun in 1845, at which time the steep gradients of the Downs between Guildford and Petersfield proved a struggle for steam traction. Journey times improved with the electrification of the line in 1937, and by the late 2000s the third-rail 750-volt DC line was served predominantly by Class 444 and Class 450 EMUs. The Class 450 EMU included with the Portsmouth Direct Line is closely modeled on the real Siemens-built Class 450 Desiro units which entered service in 2003, and features accurate controls and sound effects, plus realistic details including matrix destination displays, independent left and right door controls and more.\n\nIncludes:\nClass 450 Desiro electric multiple unit (EMU)\n\nPortsmouth Direct Line 49-mile route from Woking to Portsmouth Harbour 10 scenarios:\n\nIntroduction to Portsmouth Direct Line:\n\nIt is your first day on the Portsmouth Direct Line and you are being shadowed by a veteran driver. As you drive the line, performing passenger stops at the major stations just before rush hour, he will offer driving tips and information about the surrounding towns and areas of interest.\n\nEnd of Days:\n\nIts the end of a good days work. Take a unit on its final leg to Portsmouth Harbour, before working back to Fratton Depot.\n\nChop and Change:\n\nNot all services are straight forward end to end runs. Shunt into Woking Platform 1 before commencing a south bound service to Havant. At Guildford, detact the rear portion of the train. At Havant, attach to the waiting train and then head onto Fratton. Once loading is complete at Fratton, shunt the entire train into the yard.\n\nHalfway Haslemere:\n\nHaslemere is a key turn back point along the line. Run a return service from Guildford to Haslemere, observing the tight timings of surrounding services.\n\nHightail to the Harbour:\n\nJoin an 8-car Class 450 at Woking, on its way to Portsmouth Harbour. This is a semi-fast service so you'll only be calling at principle stations along the route.\n\nHolybourne Tanks:\n\nA weekly delivery of fuel oil is made to the industries of the Water Cress Valley near Alton in north Hampshire. Pilot todays service from the southern town of Havant, north through Guildford, and on to the terminal at Holybourne.\n\nSaturday Shunt:\n\nTake a 4-car Class 450 unit from Woking to Guildford to be used for the Ascot Shuttle Petersfield Shuffle:\n\nEngineering works on the line mean trains can only work as far as Petersfield. Operate a Sunday service as far as the blockage before turning back south for the return journey.\n\nSouthern Rail Tour:\n\nOperate a summer Saturday rail tour headed by an LMS Black5 steam locomotives to Portsmouth Harbour. Despite it being the weekend, the mainline remains a busy place. You may be required to let faster trains pass, or be delayed behind the many commuter services that operate. Do your best to get to the coast on time.\n\nWorking to Woking:\n\nAn all stops service from Portsmouth and Southsea to Waterloo. Another driver will relieve you at Woking station for the final leg along the Southern Mainline into the Capital.\n\nPlease Visit: http://1337x.org/user/RailGamer/ for instructions on how to install.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ced007a275739f39ddb32df11e170072046a1299","amp;dn":"Train+Simulator+2013+-+Portsmouth+Direct+Line","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ced007a275739f39ddb32df11e170072046a1299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,208,7,162,117,115,159,57,221,179,45,241,30,23,0,114,4,106,18,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
