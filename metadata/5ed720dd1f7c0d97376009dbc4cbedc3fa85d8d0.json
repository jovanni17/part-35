The Web began life as a jazz and soul influenced outfit, fronted by singer John L. Watson, enjoying Top Ten hit singles throughout Europe. By the time of Theraphosa Blondi the band underwent a metamorphosis, with their music taking on more Jazz and Progressive influences, resulting in an excellent album that is rightly seen as a precursor to both the album &quot;I Spider&quot; and the bands evolution into the group Samurai. Remastered by Dave Lawson, (who joined the band soon after the release of the album), this reissue of Theraphosa Blondi features two unreleased bonus tracks and a highly entertaining essay by Webs John Eaton.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ed720dd1f7c0d97376009dbc4cbedc3fa85d8d0","amp;dn":"The+Web+-+Theraphosa+Blondi+%281970%2F2008%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ed720dd1f7c0d97376009dbc4cbedc3fa85d8d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,215,32,221,31,124,13,151,55,96,9,219,196,203,237,195,250,133,216,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
