Cripple a leg to slow an enemy down, fire on their gun to blast it to bits, or aim for the head to knock them senseless â€“ or blow it clean off.\r\nExpanded Voice Over: Over 8,000 lines of new voice-over dialog have been added for the game's characters and companions, bringing the Wasteland to life like never before.\r\nOne Size Does Not Fit All: Don't feel like finding the key for a door? Why not try a Rocket Launcher! Basically the same thing... right?\r\nEnhanced Classic RPG Game Play: Classic RPG game play ideas updated with modern design philosophies.\r\nDecision Making... with Consequences: With both short and long term reactivity to the players choices, every decision matters in the outcome of the story.\r\nHuge &amp; Customizable: Dozens of hours of game.
