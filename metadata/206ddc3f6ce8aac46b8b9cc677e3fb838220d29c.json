Thanks to Cleese's reasoning the Pythons are seen to triumph,\r\nwinning over the Popular Peoples' Church. A later encounter with God will show how the film's controversy paved the way\r\nfor other artistic endeavours which prompted protest. Brilliant characterisations are vitiated by a satirical 'treatment'\r\nincluding animated sequences and irritating attempts at surreal wit when a documentary style treatment would have sufficed.\r\nSeveral of the Pythons were hostile to the film, summed up in the floor manager's comment. &quot;Another fantasy sequence...lame&quot;.\r\n- Written by don @ minifie-1\r\n\r\nSource-------- Ger BD\r\nFormat-------- mkv/avc\r\nx264----------    (me=umh,subme=11,ref=9,crf=17,qcomp=0.8)\r\nFile size----- 2.8 GB\r\nLength-------- 1:25:27\r\nVideo Bit rate ~3.7 Mbps\r\nResolution---- 1280x642\r\nFrame rate---- 25 fps\r\nAudio--------- DD 5.1 @640 Kbps\r\nSubtitles----- Eng, Pob\r\n\r\n\r\nNote by HighCode:\r\nGerman source and there are a couple of German hard-coded subtitle lines.\r\nIf you use English .ass subs they'll cover them.\r\nI improved/added Eng &amp; pt br subs in the folder.\r\nGood encoding, I recommend it.
