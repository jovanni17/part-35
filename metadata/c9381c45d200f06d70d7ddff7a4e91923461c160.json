Chapman proves a warm and delightful raconteur as he recalls skiing down a Swiss mountainside in a wooden gondola, Keith Moon (drummer for rock band the Who) using explosives to chastize a hotel manager, and appeaing naked during the filming of Monty Python's Life of Brian. Be warned: As the packaging is quick to note, the film and audio \n\nquality are not professional; this is virtually a home movie. Nonetheless, Chapman's relaxed poise and impeccable deadpan delivery give his stories a dry wit that any Python fan will enjoy. The extras, in addition to having further samples from the question-and-answer sessions with the audience, includes footage of Chapman being hurled into the air by industrial elastic and an Iron Maiden video in which he appears as a stern schoolmaster. --Bret Fetzer\n\nProduct Description\n\nIn the early 1980s, Monty PythonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Graham Chapman embarked upon a second career as a public speaker. Throughout the decade he toured hundreds of North American colleges delivering &quot;comedy lectures&quot; which consisted of tales from his life, adventures with an ad hoc group of adrenaline junkies called the Dangerous Sports Club, equally dangerous friends like the WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Keith Moon and, of course, his fellow Pythons. In the spring of 1988 he launched his final college tour before his death in 1989, the best of which is presented here, videotaped under GrahamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s supervision and taken from his personal archives. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a historical ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and hysterical - document, capturing Graham at the peak of his comedic powers, at ease and at home before a crowd of Chapmaniacs.\n\nNOTES:\n\n1 - The footage looks to have been shot with a late 80's cheap video camera, so the video sucks. However, the audio is OK, and material is funny.\n\n2 - wetmouse can fuck off.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Chapman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Chapman&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9381c45d200f06d70d7ddff7a4e91923461c160","amp;dn":"Looks+Like+a+Brown+Trouser+Job+-+Monty+Python%5C%27s+Graham+Chapman+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9381c45d200f06d70d7ddff7a4e91923461c160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,56,28,69,210,0,240,109,112,215,221,255,122,78,145,146,52,97,193,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
