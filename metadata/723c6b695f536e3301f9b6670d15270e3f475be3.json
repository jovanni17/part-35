As they grow, the cubs move from their mother's milk onto meat. Fortunately, the tigress is a skilled hunter. Charger, their imposing father, keeps his distance but helps to protect his vulnerable offspring from rogue male tigers and leopards.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEPISODE 2 - The cubs are now half-grown and very playful, learning the skills they'll need as adults.\n       \nThe half-grown cubs are learning the hunting and fighting skills they'll need as adults. The cameras also give an insight into the worlds of other animals, with leopards presenting a real threat to the growing cubs, and deer making good hunting practice. The tigers head to a water hole to cool off on a steaming hot day, and the spy-cams show that the jungle pools are a magnet for a whole array of forest animals, including wild boars and sloth bears. But disaster strikes when both the cubs' parents are injured and a rogue male puts in an appearance.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEPISODE 3 - The cubs are now a year and a half old and learning to hunt for themselves.\n \nThe cubs are now a year and a half old and their biggest challenge is learning to hunt for themselves, but their mother soon loses patience. Many new animal stars make their appearance, including an irresistible jackal family that has to cope when the tiger family invades their backyard, and a flock of peacocks that tease the tigers by playing a game of dare.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal tag  : BBC.Tiger.Spy.In.The.Jungle.Complete.Series.720p.HDTV.x264.GOTHIC\n   \n   (Downloaded and converted from 'ilovetorrens.com'- private torrent site)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGeneral #0\nFormat               : Matroska\nFile size            : 1.46 GiB     (x3)\nPlayTime\t     : 59mn 280ms   (x3)\nBit rate             : 3536 Kbps\nEncoded date         : UTC 2008-04-21 00:53:37\nWriting application  : mkvmerge v2.0.2 ('You're My Flame') built on Sep 20 2007\nWriting library      : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n   \nVideo #0\nCodec                : MPEG-4 AVC\nCodec/Info           : MPEG4 ISO advanced profile\nPlayTime             : 59mn 280ms   (x3)\nWidth                : 1280 pixels\nHeight               : 720 pixels\nAspect ratio         : 16/9\nFrame rate           : 25.000 fps\nLanguage             : English\n     \nAudio #0\nCodec                : AC3\nCodec/Info           : Dolby AC3\nChannel(s)           : 6 channels\nSampling rate        : 48 KHz\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------- &gt; (NO RAR!) &lt; -------------------------------------\n\nFew screens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MandmAabi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MandmAabi&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSeeing is believing.\n\n\nComment, rate, seed, enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:723c6b695f536e3301f9b6670d15270e3f475be3","amp;dn":"BBC.Tiger.Spy.In.The.Jungle.Complete.Series.720p.HDTV.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"723c6b695f536e3301f9b6670d15270e3f475be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,60,107,105,95,83,110,51,1,249,182,103,13,21,39,14,63,71,91,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
