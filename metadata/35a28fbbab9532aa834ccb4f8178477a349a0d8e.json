Running in excursions over former Burlington Northern trackage, the Daylight treated enthusiastic throngs of spectators to the sights and sounds of thundering steam power.\n\nPentrex was on the spot, capturing exciting scenes throughout the train's extensive route. Starting in Vancouver, Washington, we follow the train across the state and into British Columbia, Canada, and Idaho, visiting the cities of Tacoma, Seattle, Everett, Bellingham, and Vancouver, B.C. A special highlight is a ride aboard the train along the Puget Sound, from Balmer Yard in Seattle to Everett.\n\nYou'll see the EAS traveling over Stevens Pass - what an awesome sight that is! - and at Skykomish and exiting Cascade Tunnel. Continuing eastward, the train stops at Wenatchee and Spokane, then crosses the long bridge over Lake Pend Oreille on its way to Sandpoint, Idaho.\n\nDozens and dozens of runbys fill the screen with scenic images of steam railroading. There's also plenty of freight and passenger train action along the route, including Amtrak's Talgo trains.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 699 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 38mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 995 Kbps\nWriting application                      : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                          : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 1\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Custom\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 38mn\nBit rate                                 : 795 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.086\nStream size                              : 558 MiB (80%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 1h 38mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 135 MiB (19%)\nAlignment                                : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 96 ms (2.88 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 96 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a28fbbab9532aa834ccb4f8178477a349a0d8e","amp;dn":"Trains+-+Steam+Across+the+Pacific+Northwest+-+DvDRip-xvid%5ED%5E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a28fbbab9532aa834ccb4f8178477a349a0d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,162,143,187,171,149,50,170,131,76,203,79,129,120,71,122,52,154,13,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
