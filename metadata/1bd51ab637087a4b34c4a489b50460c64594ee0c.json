Folk Socks offers a collection of 18 sock patterns pulled from European and British traditions, including boot socks, Birkenstock socks, lacy stockings, kilt hose, cabled and clocked socks, and more. There is also a chapter on essential sock knitting techniques for heel turns, toe shaping, and top ribbing for knitters of all skill levels.\n\nFolk Socks still contains the same in-depth history and the same step-by-step instruction from Nancy Bush that sock knitters have come to love and depend on. Now you can get this popular resource with updated information on new yarns as well as modifications that Nancy has learned since first writing this book.\n\nA classic reference, now updated, this is a must-have for any sock knitter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd51ab637087a4b34c4a489b50460c64594ee0c","amp;dn":"Folk+Socks%3A+History+of+Handknitted+Footwear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd51ab637087a4b34c4a489b50460c64594ee0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,213,26,182,55,8,122,75,52,196,164,137,181,4,96,198,69,148,238,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
