When he finds that the police will not let the case drop, he goes into hiding and can't contact his wife and child. He arranges to meet them in Mexico where he thinks they can begin again, but finds that he must choose between his family and freedom.

He is careful about how he carries out his crimes, he never having spent more than two weeks in prison in any one sentence. He does it all to support his loving and faithful wife June, their daughter Nicky and their yet unborn child. The Edwards live from job to job, with Buster often squandering away the money on gambling. Buster believes they have hit the big time when his associates devise a plan for a Ã‚Â£1 million mail robbery aboard a train. This hit scares June as Buster has never been involved in a job this big, but they do manage to pull off the heist. The authorities initially make little headway in the case, but the government, still reeling from the Profumo Affair, place much pressure on the police to find the culprits and prosecute to the full extent of the law. When Buster is identified as one of the robbers, he and June are forced to go into hiding. But they can't live like that forever, and have to reconcile their differences in what each feels is the best thing to do in the long run.
