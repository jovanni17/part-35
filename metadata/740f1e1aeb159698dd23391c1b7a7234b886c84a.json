There is an outer reality and an inner one, and our nervous system is the doorway \nbetween them. Effective Yoga practices stimulate and open that doorway. The result? Peace, creativity, happiness, \nand a steady rise of ecstatic bliss radiating from within us... Advanced Yoga Practices (AYP) brings together the \nmost effective methods of Yoga in a flexible integrated system that anyone can use. Instructions are given in plain \nEnglish for deep meditation, spinal breathing pranayama, bodily manipulations (asanas, mudras and bandhas), \ntantric sexual practices, and other methods that are systematically applied to swing open the door of our nervous \nsystem to permanent higher experience. This is a non-sectarian approach that is compatible with any belief system \nor religious background. There are over 240 easy-to-follow lessons here, including many hands-on questions and \nanswers between Yoga practitioners and the author. Whether you are a beginner or a veteran in Yoga, the AYP \nlessons can serve as a useful resource as you travel along your chosen path. \n\nExtensive reader feedback is provided in the book. Here are a few excerpts:.........\n\n&quot;I searched for years to find a method of meditation that I can do.
