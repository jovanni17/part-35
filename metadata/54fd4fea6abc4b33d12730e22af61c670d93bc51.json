Still influenced by his earlier works his sounds were pretty dark and spherical. After being picked up by 2 Much Bass Records end of the same year he released his debut EP \\&quot;Identity\\&quot; which charted all contained Dubstep Tracks on the Beatport Top 100. \\&quot;Hagakure\\&quot; went up to #34 and gave QS alot of attention and featured his earlier signature sound. \nAfter touring Europe from Athens to London and Belgium and playing a festival in California he sat down to work on his next EP \\&quot;Angels &amp; Albatrosses\\&quot; which was signed by Play Me records. Getting DJ support from Reid Speed, Ajapai, Mark Instinct, Helicopter Showdown, Cyberoptics and many more plus featuring a track with american MC Messinian helped this release to chart very well along other big releases the same week (Excision\\'s X-Rated and Porter Robinsons Spitfire). All the tracks charted on the Beatport Top 100 again. \nCurrently focusing on another new EP which can be expected early 2012 featuring alot of Remixes and new Originals on Play Me Records he will play a few other shows over Europe.\\&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54fd4fea6abc4b33d12730e22af61c670d93bc51","amp;dn":"Quartus+Saul+-+More+Heroes+EP+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54fd4fea6abc4b33d12730e22af61c670d93bc51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,253,79,234,106,188,75,51,209,39,48,226,42,246,28,103,13,147,188,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
