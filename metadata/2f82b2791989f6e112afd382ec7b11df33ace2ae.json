Zanuck and that he didn't regard much of the film as his own. (The ending, for instance, was written by Zanuck and directed by Irving Pichel.) Nevertheless, the film has certain beauties and pleasures. Part of it was shot in Georgia's Okefenokee swamp, and the treatment of the small community living nearby is often pungent and distinctive.\nBy Jonathan Rosenbaum  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/swamp-water/Film?oid=1073855&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/swamp-water/Film?oid=1073855&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nStarring: Walter Brennan, Walter Huston, Anne Baxter, Dana Andrews, \nDirector: Jean Renoir (Irving Pichel, uncredited)\n\n\nVideo: MPEG2PAL 4:3 720x576\n\nAudio: English and Spanish Dolby AC3/2\n\nSubs: Castellano, Dansk, Deutsch, English, Norsk, Suomi, Svenska\n\n\nExtras: -\n\nStripped: -\n      \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034251/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034251/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f82b2791989f6e112afd382ec7b11df33ace2ae","amp;dn":"Swamp+Water+%5B1941%5D+Eng+and+Spa+%2B+7+subs++DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f82b2791989f6e112afd382ec7b11df33ace2ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,130,178,121,25,137,246,225,18,175,211,130,236,123,17,223,51,172,226,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
