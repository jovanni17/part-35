Money is tight and emotions run high as he constantly argues with his wife and his surviving son Blake, who is hanging with the wrong crowd and in danger of flunking out of school.\n\nSam Wright also never expected to be a police officer. He has a callingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to be a minister like his Grandpa George. But leading a small, start-up church doesn't always put enough food on the table for a young family, so Sam doubles as a police officer. With his new promotion to Sergeant, Sam starts questioning if his real calling might actually be police work rather than the pastorate.\n\nCan Mac and Sam somehow join forces to help one another when it's impossible for either of them to look past their differences ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ especially the most obvious one?\n\nEvery day, we have the opportunity to rebuild relationships and heal deep wounds by extending and receiving God's grace. Offer THE GRACE CARD... and never underestimate the power of God's love.\n\nPosted on special request.\n\nRuntime: 102 mins\nLanguage: English\nYear: 2011\nMy Rating: 9.5/10 \nQuality: 10/10 \nFormat: avi format \n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you!
