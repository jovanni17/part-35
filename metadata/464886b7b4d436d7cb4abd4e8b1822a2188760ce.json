But far more than that, the Impressions recorded some of the most distinctive vocal-group R&amp;B of the &amp;#039;60s under Mayfield&amp;#039;s guidance. Their style was marked by airy, feather-light harmonies and Mayfield&amp;#039;s influentially sparse guitar work, plus, at times, understated Latin rhythms. If their sound was sweet and lilting, it remained richly soulful thanks to the group&amp;#039;s firm grounding in gospel tradition; they popularized the three-part vocal trade-offs common in gospel but rare in R&amp;B at the time, and recorded their fair share of songs with spiritual themes, both subtle and overt. Furthermore, Mayfield&amp;#039;s interest in the civil rights movement led to some of the first socially conscious R&amp;B songs ever recorded, and his messages grew more explicit as the &amp;#039;60s wore on, culminating in the streak of brilliance that was his early-&amp;#039;70s solo work. The Impressions carried on without Mayfield, but only matched their earlier achievements in isolated instances, and finally disbanded in the early &amp;#039;80s.\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n--------------------------------------------------\n01.
