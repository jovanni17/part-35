After installation copy\nprecracked exe from the Crack folder into Book Collector Pro's\ninstalled folder, overwriting the existing file.  You now have a\nfully registered version of Book Collector Pro!\n\n*NOTE TO ALL READ NOW ABOUT TRIAL EXPIRE!:*\n\nGoing to ONCE AGAIN state the obvious because some people can't\nseem to use common sense and nuke a working release because of\ntheir stupidity.  So here we go again and state the obvious in\neach release of any Collectorz.com applications:\n\nWe have for awhile now made searching at Collectorz.com work and\nnot show illegal key, allowing book lookup to work from that\nsource, while another group's crack didn't allow any searching\nthere at all.  Now of course if you add over the 100+ normal\nlimit for Book Collector, and request data well over that limit\nfrom that source in ONE BIG SEARCH, your going to be red flagged\nand the server WILL block your IP and ONLY your IP and say your\ntrial is up (and this is ONLY for retrieval of updates from\nthem).  This again should be quite obvious with server side\nprotection and using a cracked application, but we give you the\noption to still be able to download from them, nobody else could\nbefore (method will not be explained).\n\nWe will state it again clearly, don't search over that limit in\none large update to your database!  Example would be 50 to 75\nback to back automatic searches/updates in one use.  If you do\nhalf of the normal limit (50 searches) and more at a later time,\nyou'll be fine as we have patched the counter inside your\ncollection file.  For people that refuse to listen (like you\nnuker), you have been warned and this version of Collectorz.com\nBook Collector Pro now ONLY uses Collectorz.com as it's source.\n\nChange your IP if you somehow forget this, or wait for the ban to\nbe lifted if you don't listen (YES!! using a FREE PROXY found\neasily with google, allows you once again to search right away,\nshowing you its server side!!  Proxy IP is added within the\nprogram).  You still have ALL the other Pro features anyways.\nBesides, if your using this program to store that many books, its\nabout time you paid for it and made that purchase to support this\ngreat database manager.\n\nThats it!  Enjoy.\n\nT E   2 0 1 2\n\nascii\nby mx\n\nDon't Hate The Hacker,  Hate The Code\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a28a643c5c3b3fed3bfe3acecce462241904cb8d","amp;dn":"Collectorz.com.Book.Collector.Pro.v8.0.4-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a28a643c5c3b3fed3bfe3acecce462241904cb8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,138,100,60,92,59,63,237,59,254,58,206,204,228,98,36,25,4,203,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
