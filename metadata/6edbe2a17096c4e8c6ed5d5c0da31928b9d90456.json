It was directed by Carlos Saldanha and Chris Wedge from a story by Michael J. Wilson. Its sequels are called Ice Age: The Meltdown (2006) and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009). The film was originally to be directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, and produced in 2D by Fox Animation Studios, but the rise of CGI animation and the failure of Titan A.E. destroyed Fox's traditional animation division, hence Bluth and Goldman transferred their duties for Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha from Fox's CGI division Blue Sky.\n\nThe film begins with a squirrel known as Scrat, who is trying to find a location to store his prized acorn. Eventually, as he tries to hide it, he causes an avalanche. He barely escapes, but finds himself stepped on by a herd of prehistoric animals. The animals are trying to avoid the ice age by migrating south. Sid, a clumsy ground sloth left behind by his family, is attacked by two Brontops whom he angered. Sid is soon saved by Manfred (&quot;Manny&quot;), an agitated mammoth who fights them off. Not wanting to be alone and unprotected, Sid follows Manny.\n\n\n\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 17mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1257 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;266e4f414e666a150817&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1094 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 560 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nMinimum frame rate               : 24.987 fps\nMaximum frame rate               : 25.026 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.109\n\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 232 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nLanguage                         : English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayback Problems? &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nJacket &amp; DVD @600dpi\n\n\nand you're welcome..;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6edbe2a17096c4e8c6ed5d5c0da31928b9d90456","amp;dn":"Ice+Age+2002+%5BH.264-MP4%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6edbe2a17096c4e8c6ed5d5c0da31928b9d90456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,219,226,161,112,150,196,232,198,237,93,92,13,163,25,40,185,217,4,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
