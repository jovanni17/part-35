It was recorded at the last concert before they split in May 1985 at the Rockerina Festival in Poland. It is widely regarded as the sound of a great band falling apart. This is also the only Hanoi Rocks album to feature RenÃƒÂ© Berg on bass and Terry Chimes on drums. Michael Monroe was going to leave the band before this album was released, but agreed to do a small tour in Poland, on the condition that a live record wouldn't be released. Rock &amp; Roll Divorce was a half-official release. According to Hanoi Rocks' autobiography, the album was the last date of the Polish-tour recorded by Mick Staplehurst. Which isn't quite correct, it was actually taken from several shows but mainly from Gdansk and for that reason it should have been called 'The Solidarity Tapes'. It was originally put together for the amusement of band members only! Hanoi Rocks' former manager Seppo Vesterinen, has stated that: &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Divorce was an awful record that should have never been released.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. \t&quot;Two Steps from the Move&quot;   \t \n2. \t&quot;Back to Mystery City&quot;\n3. \t&quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;   \t \n4. \t&quot;Don't You Ever Leave Me&quot;   \t\t \n5. \t&quot;Tragedy&quot;  \n6. \t&quot;Malibu Beach&quot;   \t\t \n7. \t&quot;Million Miles Away&quot;   \t \n8. \t&quot;Taxi Driver&quot;   \t \n9. \t&quot;Up Around the Bend&quot;   \t\t \n10. \t&quot;I Feel Alright&quot;   \t\t \n11. \t&quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;   \n12. \t&quot;Looking at You&quot;  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8e594d1bdf747ce89cff7233808d3fd19db876","amp;dn":"Hanoi+rocks+-+Rock+and+roll+divorce+%28live+Poland+1985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8e594d1bdf747ce89cff7233808d3fd19db876","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,142,89,77,27,223,116,124,232,156,255,114,51,128,141,63,209,157,184,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
