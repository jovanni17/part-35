GonzÃƒÂ¡lez\nand him are joined by this other bass-player turned tenor saxophonist Timo\nShanko, and with Luther Gray on drums. Morris and GonzÃƒÂ¡lez had played before on\n&quot;No Photograph Available&quot; and apparently the collaboration was worth a\nfollow-up. Three of the eight tracks are compositions by GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, all the\nother pieces are group improvisations in the real free (bop) tradition. The\nalbum starts highly rhythmic, uptempo with steady bass vamps and drum lines,\nand both horn players get all the space they need to enjoy us with their skills\n(and I laughed out loud because it is such fun at moments). But the album is\nbalanced, with slower, more moody pieces, allowing the horn players to show\nanother perspective, and I must say that Shanko outdoes himself, reaching the\nimprovisational emotional power of GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, howling, screeching, wailing,\ngoing deep, deep, deep, and making this again a great album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67562271f7e201bdd9e78b089e227231f6c01563","amp;dn":"Dennis+Gonzalez+Connecticut+Quartet+-+Songs+Of+Early+Autumn+%28200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67562271f7e201bdd9e78b089e227231f6c01563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,86,34,113,247,226,1,189,217,231,139,8,158,34,114,49,246,192,21,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
