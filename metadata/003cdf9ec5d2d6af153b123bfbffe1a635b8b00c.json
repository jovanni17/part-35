This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nMax Headroom has a song at number 40 and Don Johnson (Miami Vice) has a song at number 20.\n\nOne listener wrote in saying that when the band Brelin hit number one, he wondered how many other acts named for cities had ever hit number one. Casey says there were six others!\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What recording act has had the most top 40 hits in a single calendar year?&quot; Casey says the year was 1964, the act had 19 top forty hits and 6 number one's that year, and they are in this countdown!\n\nAfter Rolling Stone Magazine called Phil Collins the cabbage patch kid of rock 'n' roll, people started throwing cabbage patch dolls on stage during his performances. Casey tells how Mr. Collins responded to all that.\n\nCasey lists six television network actors in leading roles who went on to hit number one on the pop chart. \n\nThere is only one song title in the rock era that has ever hit number one three times. The song that did it the third time is in the top 10.\n\nOne singer in the countdown got a &quot;cease and desist order&quot; from a judge to stop him from singing songs about Jesus in church. When he decided to continue, the media heard about it, the Today Show sent cameras, and this singer got his big break.\n\n40:    Paranoimia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Art Of Noise With Max Headroom\n39:    We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jermaine Stewart\n38:    Mad About You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Belinda Carlisle        \n37:    Girl Can't Help It - Journey     \n36:    Glory Of Love (Theme From &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Cetera     \n35:    Point Of No Return Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nu Shooz    \n34:    Earth Angel (From &quot;Karate Kid Part II&quot;) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ New Edition\n33:    I Didn't Mean To Turn You On Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Robert Palmer\nLDD: In Your Wildest Dreams Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Moody Blues\n32:    Sweet Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Anita Baker\n31:    Money$ Too Tight (To Mention) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Simply Red\n30:    True Colors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cyndi Lauper\n29:    A Matter Of Trust Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billy Joel    \n28:    Rumors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Timex Social Club\n27:    Papa Don't Preach Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Madonna\n26:    Love Walks In Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Van Halen\n25:    Twist And Shout Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Beatles\n24:    Man Size Love (From &quot;Running Scared&quot;) - Klymaxx\n23:    All Cried Out Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam With Full Force\n22:    Heaven In Your Eyes - Loverboy\n21:    Press Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul McCartney\n20:    Heartbeat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Don Johnson\n19:    Typical Male Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tina Turner\n18:    Missionary Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Eurythmics\n17:    Throwing It All Away - Genesis\n16:    The Captain Of Her Heart - Double\n15:    Two Of Hearts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stacey Q\n14:    When I Think Of You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Janet Jackson\n13:    Sweet Freedom (Theme From &quot;Running Scared&quot;) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Michael McDonald\n12:    Higher Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Steve Winwood\n11:    Love Zone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billy Ocean\n10:    Baby Love - Regina\n9:    Dreamtime Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Daryl Hall\n8:    Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Glass Tiger\n7:    Venus - Bananarama\n6:    Walk This Way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Run-D.M.C.\n5:    Words Get In The Way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Miami Sound Machine\nLDD: Daniel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elton John\n4:    Take My Breath Away (Theme From &quot;Top Gun&quot;) - Berlin\n3:    Friends And Lovers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Carl Anderson And Gloria Loring\n2:    Dancing On The Ceiling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lionel Richie\n1:    Stuck With You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:003cdf9ec5d2d6af153b123bfbffe1a635b8b00c","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1986_September_20th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"003cdf9ec5d2d6af153b123bfbffe1a635b8b00c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,60,223,158,197,210,214,175,21,59,18,59,251,255,225,166,53,184,176,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
