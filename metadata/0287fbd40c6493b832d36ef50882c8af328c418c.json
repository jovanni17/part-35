The appearance of Neil Young and company was merely rumored and Dylan's performance was a complete surprise. Completely unrehearsed, some of this music is great.  Dylan debuts I Want You live, but unfortunately he can't be heard for most of the song. Mostly what we hear is Rick Danko shouting the chorus. Hearing the Band without Robbie Robertson is weird at first, but Ben Keith makes up for it very nicely. The oddest thing on this tape is the Helpless/Knockin' medley where Dylan substitutes &quot;knockin' on the dragon's door&quot; for &quot;knockin' on heaven's door&quot;. I have no idea what he meant by it! The entire set is approximately 45 minutes\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0287fbd40c6493b832d36ef50882c8af328c418c","amp;dn":"SNACK+Benefit+Concert+-+Young+-+Dylan+-+Jerry+Garcia+%26+Friends+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0287fbd40c6493b832d36ef50882c8af328c418c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,135,251,212,12,100,147,184,50,211,110,245,8,130,200,175,50,140,65,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
