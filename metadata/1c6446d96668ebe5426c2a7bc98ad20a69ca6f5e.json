The director signs a cinematic adaptation of this Agatha Christie story: actually it is really as if the camera went on stage for filming the play. But the film is passionating and exciting, there's no time to get bored.\n\nAnother thing we shall not forget is that Billy Wilder is European. He manages to keep the spirit of the film very British, with lots of humour and sarcasm. Compared to films like this one, &quot;legal&quot; movies from John Grisham's novels are empty and meaningless, without soul.\n\nMr.Wilder is the director, we know; we have Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich: what a cast! Add a superb black and white cinematography... The result is amazing, with a film where dialogues are flawless and carry everything.\n\n\nSubTitles:\nPortuguese\nSpanish\nFrench","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c6446d96668ebe5426c2a7bc98ad20a69ca6f5e","amp;dn":"Witness+for+the+Prosecution+%281957%29+DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c6446d96668ebe5426c2a7bc98ad20a69ca6f5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,100,70,217,102,104,235,229,66,108,42,123,201,138,210,10,105,202,111,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
