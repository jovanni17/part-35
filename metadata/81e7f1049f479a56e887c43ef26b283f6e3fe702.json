In the southern continents it was the powerful\nand muscular abelisaurids that reigned supreme but it was the famous tyrannosaurids [or\ntyrant dinosaurs] that dominated in the north.\n\nWhilst the Northern Daspletosaurus hunted in gangs, using its highly developed smell and\nhearing to take down opponents like the horned rhino-sized beast, Chasmosaurus, in the\nSouthern hemisphere the small skulled Majungasaurus reigned. And though the sharp\ntoothed Majungasaurus was an efficient killer of the much smaller feathered Rahonavis, that\ndid not stop it from occasionally turning cannibal and hunting its own.\n\nJohn Hurt ...
