Auxiliaries including the NSKK, Transportkorps Speer, Reichsarbeitsdienst and Organization Todt supported the Wehrmacht in their duties. In 1944, the strength of these organizations peaked at 3,800,000 - 40% of the size of the armed forces. As they became increasingly aware of their importance, the Auxiliaries introduced uniform and insignia modifications which made them virtually indistinguishable from their comrades in the armed forces. This book examines the organization, uniforms and history of the various Wehrmacht auxiliary forces","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b76b6df6c2f89dca1ebb4e28e811eec9102c536","amp;dn":"Wehrmacht+Auxiliary+Forces","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b76b6df6c2f89dca1ebb4e28e811eec9102c536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,118,182,223,108,47,137,220,161,235,180,226,142,129,30,236,145,2,197,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
