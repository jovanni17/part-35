I don't know if he's doing it too much, there's a lot of humor to be found in race relations and Peters' comedy isn't as tasteless as it could be, and it's occasionally quite funny. He does good impressions and though his written jokes are funny enough the best parts of the concert are the improvised bits when he interacts with the audience, which he does a lot.\n\nIf racial humor just isn't your thing, &quot;Russel Peters: Outsourced&quot; just isn't something you shouldAs someone who thinks it can be funny, if a little irritating at times, I enjoyed this DVD, although his previous concert was far superior.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beafa485182997982986ca44bf6d2edb2cf7b7d3","amp;dn":"Russell.Peters.Outsourced.2006.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beafa485182997982986ca44bf6d2edb2cf7b7d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,175,164,133,24,41,151,152,41,134,202,68,191,109,46,219,44,247,183,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
