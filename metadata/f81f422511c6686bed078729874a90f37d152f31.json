Kid Rock released several studio albums that mostly went unnoticed before his 1998 record Devil Without a Cause, released with Atlantic Records, sold 11 million albums behind the hits, &quot;Bawitdaba&quot;, &quot;Cowboy&quot;, and &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot;. In 2000, he released The History of Rock, a compilation of remixed and remastered versions of songs from previous albums as well as the hit single, &quot;American Bad Ass&quot; and the previously unreleased &quot;Abortion&quot;.\n\nKid Rock released the follow-up in 2001, Cocky. After a slow start, his country-flavored hit &quot;Picture&quot; with Sheryl Crow resurrected the album and it went gold as a single and pushed the album's sales over 5 million. It was followed by 2003's self-titled release, which did not chart a major hit. In 2006 he released Live Trucker, a live album.\n\nIn 2007 Kid Rock released Rock n Roll Jesus, which produced a hit in &quot;All Summer Long&quot;. It was his first worldwide smash hit, charting #1 in eight countries across Europe and in Australia.[1][2] Rock N Roll Jesus sold 5 million albums worldwide and was certified triple platinum in the U.S. He released Born Free on November 16, 2010. It was announced on June 16, 2011 that &quot;Born Free&quot; was certified platinum by the 'Recording Industry Association Of America' (RIAA) for selling more than one million copies. This gives Kid Rock his sixth Platinum album certification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Polyfuze Method 1993\n\n\nThe Polyfuze Method is the second album from Kid Rock, released in 1993 on indie label Continuum Records. The album has been long out of print and nearly impossible to find at any store, but can still be found used for sale on the Internet. The Polyfuze Method shows Kid Rock developing a more rap rock sound.[2] In 1997 Kid Rock re-released the album under the title The Polyfuze Method Revisited, but the re-release has also been long out of print. The Polyfuze Method Revisited contained three tracks that weren't on the original version - &quot;I Am The Bullgod&quot; and &quot;Rollin' on the Island&quot; from Kid Rock's Fire It Up EP, and the demo &quot;Rain Check&quot;. There was also a European release of the album that had a different track listing and omitted the skit &quot;T.V. Dinner&quot;.\n\n&quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, &quot;Fuck U Blind&quot; and &quot;My Oedipus Complex&quot; were later completely re-recorded and released on The History of Rock in 2000 along with a shorter version of the original &quot;3 Sheets to the Wind&quot;.[3] The vocals for &quot;I Am The Bullgod&quot; were re-recorded for Devil Without a Cause in 1998 and became his first hit song that gained heavy rotation on radio and MTV. During his 1999 tours he performed &quot;Balls In Your Mouth&quot; from the album as well.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Fred&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:25\n2.\t&quot;Killin' Brain Cells&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n3.\t&quot;Prodigal Son&quot; - 5:18\n4.\t&quot;The Cramper&quot; - 4:12\n5.\t&quot;3 Sheets to the Wind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n6.\t&quot;Fuck U Blind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n7.\t&quot;Desperate-Rado&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n8.\t&quot;Back From the Dead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n9.\t&quot;My Oedipus Complex&quot; - 5:35\n10.\t&quot;Balls in Your Mouth&quot; - 3:48\n11.\t&quot;Trippin' With Dick Vitale&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n12.\t&quot;TV Dinner&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:47\n13.\t&quot;Pancake Breakfast&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n14.\t&quot;Blow Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31\n15.\t&quot;In So Deep&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:59\n16.\t&quot;U Don't Know Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Mornin' Stoned Pimp 1996\n\n\nEarly Mornin' Stoned Pimp was Kid Rock's third full length album, It was distributed by his own label, Top Dog Records. There are two pressings of this CD, the first, the 1996 original pressing, has the Top Dog logo on the actual CD while the 1999 reissue it just a basic labeled disc. Kid Rock used the money he made from his 1994/1995 monthly Bootleg Series cassettes as well as becoming the janitor at The White Room Studios to purchase recording time. &quot;Intro&quot; has been used by the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons at their games. This album is not backed musically by the Twisted Brown Trucker Band as many report. He did not start arranging the group into a full-fledged backing band until he began pushing for major label attention in 1997.\n\nThere are 3 different alternative covers for the cassette release. The 1st is commonly known as the &quot;blurry&quot; version. There is also a &quot;Joe C&quot; version and a very rare &quot;CD cover&quot; cassette as well. Kid Rock sold a green label pressing of the album in concert in 1999. The songs &quot;Where U At Rock&quot; and &quot;Black Chick, White Guy&quot; were remade for his Devil Without A Cause release. While &quot;Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp&quot;, &quot;Paid&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Go Back&quot;, and &quot;Ya Keep On&quot; were completely rerecorded for the The History of Rock album with additional samples, piano parts, and guitar parts. The Prodigal Son Returns was the intro to Prodigal Son, but it was left off the final version from The Polyfuze Method. Shotgun Blast was renamed Blast in 1999 and was used on the soundtrack to WCW Mayhem The Music.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Intro&quot; 0:50\n2.\t&quot;Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp&quot; (feat.

Produced by Kid Rock with John Travis, it was released in 1998 by Atlantic Records. The album was certified 11 times Platinum &amp; by the RIAA by April 2003.[4] It is Kid Rock's last album to be categorized as &quot;Hip Hop&quot; before crossing over to more traditional Rock music.\n\nThe album's lead single was the rap anthem &quot;Welcome 2 the Party (Ode 2 the Old School)&quot;, which failed to find success. The album didn't garner any attention until &quot;I Am the Bullgod&quot; was released; the single peaked at #31 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and garnered the attention of MTV.\n\n&quot;Bawitdaba&quot;, the third single, bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at #4, but nevertheless was successful on rock radio, peaking at #10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and #11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\n&quot;Cowboy&quot;, the fourth single, charted at #82 on the Hot 100 and #34 on the Mainstream Top 40, as well as #5 on the Modern Rock Tracks and #10 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. The fifth single was &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot;, which charted at #19 on the Hot 100 and #6 on the Mainstream Top 40, with peaks of #5 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and #13 on the Modern Rock Tracks. Finally, the album's sixth and final single was &quot;Wasting Time&quot;, which was a minor mainstream rock hit at #35.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Bawitdaba&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Cowboy&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; (feat.

After acquiring the rights to his indie-label recordings, Rock decided to release a compilation of older material. The album contains material from the albums The Polyfuze Method and Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp. The liner notes state that Rock re-recorded the songs from Polyfuze because he couldn't find the master recordings, and &quot;remixed and touched up&quot; the EMSP tracks to show how they would've sounded if Rock had the money to record them properly at the time. There are also three previously unreleased songs from those album sessions (&quot;Born 2 Be a Hick&quot; from the Polyfuze sessions in 1992, &quot;Dark and Grey&quot; and &quot;Abortion&quot; from the EMSP sessions in 1994). The only new tracks were &quot;American Bad Ass&quot;, which was the first single from the album, and &quot;Fuck That&quot;, which had been used previously for the Any Given Sunday soundtrack. &quot;Fuck U Blind&quot; was re-written from the original version, most likely to avoid a lawsuit from Madonna.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Intro&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;American Bad Ass&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Prodigal Son&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Paid&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp&quot; (feat.

Twisted Brown Trucker)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCocky 2001\n\n\nCocky was Kid Rock's third album released with Atlantic Records, released in 2001. The album marked his transformation from rap metal to full fledged southern rock and country singer on later releases. The release of &quot;Picture&quot; featuring Sheryl Crow revived the struggling album in 2003 and in May 2011 was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA. The album was in tribute to Joe C who died the year before. There were 75 songs written for the album, 30 of them were recorded as a song for the album. One of the recorded songs that didn't make the album was &quot;If I Was President&quot;, a standard blues song that he plays frequently in concert. Another song left off the album was &quot;In Your Lifetime&quot;, which was a eulogy to Joe C. &quot;Picture&quot; received a CMA nomination in 2003 for Vocal Event of the Year and would go on to be his first gold single.\n\nThe album's 1st single was the rap rock boasting &quot;Forever&quot;. The song charted at #18 on mainstream rock &amp; #21 Modern Rock. It was also a Top 40 hit in Australia (#27) and Top 100 Hit in Sweden (#75). The 2nd single was the ballad &quot;Lonely Road Of Faith&quot;, released in January 2002. The song was heavily promoted by WWE in the video tribute to the History of WWE. The song would peak at #15 on the mainstream rock tracks. In July 2002, &quot;You Never Met A Motherfucker Quite Like Me&quot; was released to radio and peaked at #32 on the mainstream rock tracks. The albums final single revived a struggling &quot;Cocky&quot;. Kid Rock released &quot;Picture&quot; in November 2002 with Allison Moorer. The original version was recorded with Sheryl Crow, but Sheryl Crow management wanted nothing to do with Kid Rock.[citation needed] As the Allison Moorer version began climbing the country charts, Sheryl Crow's people changed their minds.[citation needed] The Sheryl Crow version was released in January 2003. It would become Kid Rock's first crossover hit charting at #4 on the Hot 100, No #5 on the Top 40, #2 AC &amp; #17 at country radio. The single would be certified gold and spend 52 weeks on top the Country Singles Sales Chart and it also peaked at #1 on the U.S. Singles Sales charts and #2 on the Canada Singles Sales Charts. The song would be Sheryl Crow's second most successful single after &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Trucker Anthem&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Forever&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Lay It On Me&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Cocky&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;What I Learned Out On The Road&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;I'm Wrong, But You Ain't Right&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Lonely Road of Faith&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;You Never Met a Motherfucker Quite Like Me&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Picture&quot; (featuring Sheryl Crow)\n10.\t&quot;I'm A Dog&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Midnight Train to Memphis&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Baby Come Home&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Drunk In the Morning&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;WCSR&quot; (featuring Snoop Dogg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKid Rock 2003\n\n\nKid Rock is an eponymous album by Kid Rock and his fourth Atlantic Records album. It was released in 2003. It was critically acclaimed by Rolling Stone Magazine, they named it one of the 50 Greatest Albums of 2003. The album saw two covers: the Bob Seger number &quot;Hard Night For Sarah,&quot; which had been never released since Bob Seger wrote it in 1979, and Bad Company's &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot;. &quot;Single Father&quot; landed him on the country chart for a second straight album. It charted as Rock's 3rd best country single and was written by country musician David Allan Coe. The album was his poorest selling release since he broke into the mainstream in 1998.\n\nThe album's lead single was a cover of Bad Company's &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot;. It was released October 2, 2003 to radio and peaked at #33 on the Mainstream Rock charts. In January 2004 he released the dark southern metal song &quot;Jackson, Mississippi&quot; to rock stations and the country love ballad &quot;Cold and Empty&quot; to AC and Pop stations. Jackson peaked at #14 on the Mainstream Rock charts while Cold and Empty peaked at #20 on the AC charts. The song failed to chart on either the Top 40 or Hot 100. In July 2004 he followed the same route releasing dual singles again, releasing the acoustic ballad &quot;I Am&quot; to rock radio and the country ballad &quot;Single Father&quot; to country radio. I Am peaked at #28 on the Mainstream Rock charts. Single Father would become Kid Rock's second charting country song, after Picture. It would peak at #50.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Rock N Roll Pain Train&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Cadillac Pussy&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Feel Like Makin' Love Bad Company&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Black Bob&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Jackson, Mississippi&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Cold and Empty&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Intro&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Rock N Roll&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Hillbilly Stomp&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;I Am&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Son of Detroit&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Do It for You&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Hard Night for Sarah&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Run Off to LA&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;Single Father (Bonus Track)&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Trucker 2006\n\n\nLive Trucker is a live album by Kid Rock released on February 28, 2006.
