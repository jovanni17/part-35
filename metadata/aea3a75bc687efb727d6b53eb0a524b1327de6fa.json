The album was not nearly as critically acclaimed as its predecessor Soundbombing 2, but was able to sell moderately well, led by the single &quot;The Life&quot;, featuring Styles P and Pharoahe Monch. Taking after 2000's Lyricist Lounge 2, Soundbombing III furthers the label's transition to a more commercial sound, which caused harsh criticisms from die-hard Rawkus fans. The album features Styles P, Pharoahe Monch, Mos Def, Skillz, Missy Elliott, Kool G Rap, Capone-N-Noreaga, Hi-Tek, Jonell, Method Man, Zap Mama, Talib Kweli, Common, Q-Tip, The Beatnuts, DJ Quik, Novel, The Roots, Cocoa Brovaz, Dawn Penn and R.A. The Rugged Man. The compilation is hosted by Cipha Sounds and Mr. Choc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aea3a75bc687efb727d6b53eb0a524b1327de6fa","amp;dn":"Rawkus+presents+Soundbombing+III","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aea3a75bc687efb727d6b53eb0a524b1327de6fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,163,167,91,198,135,239,183,39,214,181,62,176,165,36,177,50,125,230,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
