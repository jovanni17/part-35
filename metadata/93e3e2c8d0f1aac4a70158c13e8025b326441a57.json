You assume the role of a futuristic archeologist/thief who scavenges antiquities and sells them to the highest bidder. The ultimate prize in Azrael's Tear is the Holy Grail, which should fetch a handsome price since it is possibly the only thing that can save a doomed earth from complete annihilation.\n\n\nThe story\nThis is the best story made in adveture games ever. Intriguing plot, intristing characters and good storytelling.\n\nThe puzzles\n100% connected and build in the game world. No stupid riddles.\n\n\nThe graphics\nA little bit blocky as for 2008 year. However I have been shocked that it is has not grown old from that time. Big textures, uneven walls, light effcts, artiscticly prepeared and designed locations. It steel makes impression.\n\nInstalling instructions:\n1. Download.\n2. Mount in daemon tools or other.\n3. Copy full cintent to a disc - this will be your virtual CD location\n4. Start Dosbox - 0.72 or later - automatic options are enough however you can experiment a little bit with processor speed. Note that the game runs too fast in the first location but runs much more adequate in all other ones so to check the adequate speed go through any doors for game to load another location.\n5. Setup the game in the dos enviroment\n6. Make the sound setup - soundblaster or gravis are enbough (dosbox emulates them for you).\n7. Turn off the lights in the room - i mean it if you want to experience the mood of the intro!\n8. Play and enjoy!!!:)\n\nReviews: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Azraels_Tear/AzraelsTear.shtm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Azraels_Tear/AzraelsTear.shtm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDosbox: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------\nThis is my first torrent in my life - please comment if it works ok.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93e3e2c8d0f1aac4a70158c13e8025b326441a57","amp;dn":"Azrael%5C%27s+Tear+Full+CD+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93e3e2c8d0f1aac4a70158c13e8025b326441a57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,227,226,200,208,241,170,196,167,1,88,193,62,128,37,179,38,68,26,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
