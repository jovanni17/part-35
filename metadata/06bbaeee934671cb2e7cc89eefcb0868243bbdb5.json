As one of the first hardcore albums, it was a galvanizing influence on the musical and attitudinal development of the genre, also helping to kickstart the fertile California scene. \r\nThe record's tactics are not subtle in the least; Jello Biafra's odd warble and spat-out lyrics leave no doubt as to what he thinks, baiting his targets of conservatism, violence, overbearing authority, and capitalist greed with a viciously satirical sarcasm that keeps his unflinchingly political outlook from becoming too didactic. The thin production dilutes some of the music's power, but the ragged speed-blur still packs a wallop, and the hooks cribbed from surf and rockabilly give it a gonzo edge. \r\nThe songwriting isn't consistent all the way through the album, but classics like &quot;Kill the Poor,&quot; &quot;Let's Lynch the Landlord,&quot; &quot;Chemical Warfare,&quot; &quot;California Ãœber Alles,&quot; and &quot;Holiday In Cambodia&quot; helped define the hardcore genre and, thus, must be heard.
