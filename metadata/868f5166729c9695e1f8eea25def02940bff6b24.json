We believe on the ground idealism of the root\nof the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and\nnothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do\nthis for the competition and the heart of what got the scene\nstarted in the mid eighties.\n\nIf you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back\non contacting us as soon as possible.\n\n/\n/ / // / / / /\n/ / / / // //// / / / / / /\n/ / / / / // / /// /\n/// / //////\ntwice the fun / double the trouble\n\nOn with the update release information:\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Update 1\n================================\n\n- Friends fix for join in progress and Friends tab in server\nbrowser\n\n- Performance improvement for dual and quad core systems\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1. Unpack the included rar files.\n2. Run Call.of.Duty.Black.Ops.Update.1.exe and install\n3. Copy the cracked content from SKIDROW directory to your\nmain installation directory and overwrite.\n4. Play the game\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nOur Call of Duty: Black Ops release works perfectly(alot have\nalready completed the game with our crack), sadly our Zombies\nSolo mode enabler release gave RELOADED the oppertunity to try\nand fool the scene with another stupid proper. Shall we even\nmention the Just Cause 2 &quot;proper&quot; from them?\n\nActually they were in such haste to find a reason to proper\nour initial game release, that they did release a &quot;crackfix&quot;\nthat ruins more than it fixes.\n\nNice try RELOADED, but apparently you didn't had the time to\ndig deeper into the understanding of Steamworks CEG protection\nand the reason why your &quot;crackfix&quot; does not work at all. You\neven left quite a few checks untouched.\n\nGreetings:\n\nSalutes to our old Amiga friends from:\n\nFAIRLIGHT - RAZOR 1911 - VISION FACTORY - PARADOX - QUARTEX\nDCS - CRYSTAL - ZENITH - ACCESSSION - ALPHA FLIGHT - PRODIGY\nTHE COMPANY - LEGEND - TRSI - ORACLE - ANTHROX - CLASSIC\n\nSalutes to our new friends in:\n\nUNLEASHED - TiNYiSO - BReWErS - RADIKAL - POSTMORTEM - SHOCK\nFAIRLIGHT - CRUDE - VACE - ReUnion - OUTLAWS - GENESIS\n\nLogo and layout by: Eboy/SAE\nLast updated 21/07/2007 by XXX\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:868f5166729c9695e1f8eea25def02940bff6b24","amp;dn":"Call.of.Duty.Black.Ops.Update.1.Read.Nfo-SKIDROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"868f5166729c9695e1f8eea25def02940bff6b24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,143,81,102,114,156,150,149,225,248,238,162,93,239,2,148,11,255,107,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
