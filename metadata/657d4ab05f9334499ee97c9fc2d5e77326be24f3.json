Employing traditional styles and contemporary colors, crocheted blocks inspire crafters to create a dynamic palette of color, pattern, and texture by mixing, matching, and combining. Step-by-step instructions accompany each pattern, along with stunning photographs that encourage crocheters to explore a range of color combinations and coordinates. A directory of blocks is cross-referenced with symbols that describe the techniques used and the degree of difficulty, and each pattern is designed so that finished blocks are the same size when they are worked in yarn of the same weight. A useful refresher course of crochet stitches and techniques is included, as are patterns for edgings and instructions on making fringes to finish off afghans in style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:657d4ab05f9334499ee97c9fc2d5e77326be24f3","amp;dn":"200+Crochet+Blocks+for+Blankets+Throws+and+Afghans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"657d4ab05f9334499ee97c9fc2d5e77326be24f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,125,74,176,95,147,52,73,158,233,124,159,194,213,231,115,38,190,36,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
