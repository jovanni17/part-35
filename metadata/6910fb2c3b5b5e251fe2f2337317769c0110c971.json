Omaha still has the marks of a filthy Wild West town, even as it attempts to achieve the grandeur and respectability of nearby Chicago. But when he crosses paths with the beautiful and enigmatic Cecily, his whole purpose shifts and the fair becomes the backdrop to their love affair.\n\nOne of a traveling troupe of actors that has descended on the city, Cecily works in the MidwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chamber of Horrors, where she loses her head hourly on a guillotine playing Marie Antoinette. And after closing, she rushes off, clinging protectively to a mysterious carpetbag, never giving Ferret a second glance. But a moonlit ride on the swan gondola, a boat on the lagoon of the New White City, changes everything, and the fairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magic begins to take its effect.\n\nFrom the critically acclaimed author of The Coffins of Little Hope, The Swan Gondola is a transporting read, reminiscent of Water for Elephants or The Night Circus.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6910fb2c3b5b5e251fe2f2337317769c0110c971","amp;dn":"The+Swan+Gondola+-+Timothy+Schaffert.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6910fb2c3b5b5e251fe2f2337317769c0110c971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,16,251,44,59,91,94,37,31,226,242,51,115,23,118,156,1,16,201,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
