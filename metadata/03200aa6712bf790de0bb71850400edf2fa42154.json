This was out in late 07 for the 08 model year and it should work on Civic, Fit, Element and CR-Vs.  Not sure about other Honda models.  It was up before once but now it's gone and since I was making a backup DVD of mine, I decided to share it because I know there are some people that don't have a navi disk at all.\n\n\nHow to burn disk:\n\nUse WinRAR to unpack files onto a folder\n\nIf you don't already have imgburn or an iso. burner program, go ahead and install imgburn.(program supplied)\n\n1. Insert a blank dual layered DVD in your dual layer burning drive\n\n2. Open imgburn and choose &quot;write image file to disc&quot;\n\n3. Click on the &quot;browse for file...&quot; folder icon, choose the MDS file(not the iso.) or simply click and drag the MDS file to imgburn  \n\n4. Choose a write speed of 8x or under \n\n5. Click on write icon and wait til dvd is burned\n\n6. Test out the navi DVD \n\n7. Enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03200aa6712bf790de0bb71850400edf2fa42154","amp;dn":"Honda+Navigation+DVD+6.62A+Update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03200aa6712bf790de0bb71850400edf2fa42154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,32,10,166,113,43,247,144,222,11,183,24,80,64,14,223,47,164,33,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
