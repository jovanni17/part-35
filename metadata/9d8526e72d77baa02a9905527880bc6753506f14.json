Enraged over Mengsk's betrayal of the powerful telepath, Sarah Kerrigan, to the ravenous Zerg, Raynor has lost all faith in his fellow humanity.\nYet, in the aftermath of Mengsk's treachery, Raynor is plagued by strange visions of Char -- a deadly, volcanic world haunted by horrifying alien creatures. As the nightmares grow in intensity, Raynor begins to suspect that they may not be figments of his imagination -- but a desperate form of telepathic contact. Convinced that the woman he loves is still alive, Raynor launches a hasty mission to rescue Kerrigan from Char. But deep beneath the planet's smoldering surface, Raynor finds a strange chrysalis...and is forced to watch in horror as a terrible, all-too-familiar entity rises from it.\n\nBefore him stands a creature of depthless malice and vengeance...\n\nSarah Kerrigan: the Zerg Queen of Blades.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d8526e72d77baa02a9905527880bc6753506f14","amp;dn":"Starcraft%3A+Queen+of+Blades","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d8526e72d77baa02a9905527880bc6753506f14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,133,38,231,45,119,186,160,42,153,5,82,120,128,188,103,83,80,111,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
