John Hodgman may now be the go-to guy for the droll-everyman-navigating-his-way-through-the-universe story (already nailing it in 2012Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s hilarious Year Zero). Hand-picked by Neil Gaiman (whose charming audio introduction perfectly sets the stage for whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to come) Hodgman lends the right amount of nerd-cred to this adventure, which was originally published in 1968 and is a clear forerunner to Douglas AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ classic The HitchhikerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to the Galaxy. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had a chance to hear an advance excerpt of the audio, and I just have to know how Carmody, the unsuspecting winner of a Galactic Lottery, makes his way back to Earth in one piece.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Chris, Audible Editor\nPublisher's Summary\n\nAward-winning author, narrator, and screenwriter Neil Gaiman personally selected this book, and, using the tools of the Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX), produced this work for his audiobook label, Neil Gaiman Presents.\n\nA few words from Neil on Dimension of Miracles: &quot;Dimension of Miracles is probably not [Sheckley's] most famous bookÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. but I think it's probably his best-loved book. It's about the joys and tribulations (mostly the tribulations) of winning the lotteryÃ¢â‚¬â€the galactic lotteryÃ¢â‚¬â€accidentally. And wrongly. Tom Carmody is awarded a remarkable prize, is taken half way across the universe to collect it, finds himself hopelessly lost, and needs to find his way home again to EarthÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to this Earth, not an alternate, weirdo Earth. He's got to get back. And the price is high.\n\nIn its style of humorÃ¢â‚¬â€and even in some of the jokesÃ¢â‚¬â€Dimension of Miracles is very obviously a precursor of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Douglas actually hadn't read Dimension of Miracles until very shortly after Hitchhiker came out, when people pointed him to it, and he told me that he found the experience almost shockingÃ¢â‚¬â€it was like reading himself. He was a huge admirer of Bob Sheckley and a huge admirer of this book, and in later life, I had the privilege of introducing both of them.\n\nNow the challenge for me with a book this funny, this strange, this perceptive was to try and find a narrator who was as iconic, somebody who could deliver the goods, somebody who could give you a book like this as it deserved to be given. And the first, and the last, and actually the only person to come to mind was John Hodgman. So I asked John, and he said yes! And he did it; he pulled it off. Listening to JohnÃ¢â‚¬â€not just the suave, sensible, sane narrator of this book, but all the peculiar accents and incarnations that he is forced to adopt through hereÃ¢â‚¬â€he does it delightfully, he does it brilliantly, he's really, really funny. And so is this book. Enjoy your journey through a Dimension of Miracles.&quot;\n\nDimension of Miracles is a satirical science fiction novel first published by Dell in 1968. It's about Tom Carmody, a New Yorker who, thanks to a computer error, wins the main prize in the Intergalactic Sweepstakes. Tom claims his prize before the error is discovered and is allowed to keep it. However, since Tom is a human from Earth without galactic status and no space traveling experience, he has no homing instinct that can guide him back to Earth once his odyssey begins - and the galactic lottery organizers cannot transport him home. Meanwhile, his removal from Earth has caused a predatory entity to spring into existence - one that pursues and aims to destroy him. Carmody is on the run, and he ends up transporting from Earth to Earth - different phases and realities of the planet, which of course is not the time or condition he expects.\n\nLearn more about Neil Gaiman Presents and Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX).\n\nÃ‚Â©1968 Robert Sheckley (P)2013 Robert Sheckley\nWhat the Critics Say\n\n&quot;Hodgman, probably best known to geeks for his appearances on The Daily Show and his role as the PC in those Apple commercials a few years back, has a dryly intelligent deadpan that wonderfully counterpoints the absurd adventures of Thomas Carmody, a mid 20th-century New York everyman whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s invited to a galactic center to collect a sweepstakes prize.&quot; (Locus)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b772e2e796032309da3e40721b9cc3fe6059c27","amp;dn":"Audible+Rip+-+Robert+Sheckley+-+Dimension+of+Miracles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b772e2e796032309da3e40721b9cc3fe6059c27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,119,46,46,121,96,50,48,157,163,228,7,33,185,204,63,230,5,156,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
