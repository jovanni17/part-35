The history of sex and the body is an expanding field in which vibrant debate on, for instance, the history of homosexuality, is developing. This book examines the current scholarship and looks towards future directions across the field.\n\nThe volume is divided into fourteen thematic chapters, which are split into two chronological sections 1500 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1750 and 1750 to present day. Focusing on the history of sexuality and the body in the West but also interactions with a broader globe, these thematic chapters survey the major areas of debate and discussion. Covering themes such as science, identity, the gaze, courtship, reproduction, sexual violence and the importance of race, the volume offers a comprehensive view of the history of sex and the body. The book concludes with an afterword in which the reader is invited to consider some of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtensions, problems and areas deserving further scrutinyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nIncluding contributors renowned in their field of expertise, this ground-breaking collection is essential reading for all those interested in the history of sexuality and the body.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bed40c443080e30aa7c21f343feb81d8c7c6269","amp;dn":"The+Routledge+History+of+Sex+and+the+Body%2C+1500+to+the+Present","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bed40c443080e30aa7c21f343feb81d8c7c6269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,237,64,196,67,8,14,48,170,124,33,243,67,254,184,29,140,124,98,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
