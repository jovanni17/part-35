Then in the second round, something's fishy in the basket, and one chef's dish is at risk when two competitors bump into each other. And with a spot in the $50,000 All-Stars finale and a favorite charity on the line, two finalists go head-to-head in the dessert round. Will their creations from marshmallow and coconut flakes make the judges happy?\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 07-Apr-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3033807fecfb820c4a2a75adf34bd83202bb46b8","amp;dn":"Chopped.S14E09.All.Stars.Part.1.HDTV.XviD-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3033807fecfb820c4a2a75adf34bd83202bb46b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,51,128,127,236,251,130,12,74,42,117,173,243,75,216,50,2,187,70,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
