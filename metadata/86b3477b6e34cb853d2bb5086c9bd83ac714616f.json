The album is a collection of songs from the third and fourth decades of the band (1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008), which they spent signed to Atlantic Records. \n\nRetrospective III: 1989-2008 displays the covers of six albums - Vapor Trails, Test For Echo, Counterparts, Roll The Bones, Presto, and alternate artwork for Snakes &amp; Arrows - on the wall, while that of the Feedback EP rests on the floor. The Snakes &amp; Arrows art, designed by Hugh Syme, was originally used on that album's insert and later appeared on the cover of the Snakes &amp; Arrows Live album; the portion featuring the battered road sign was used for the DVD version. The dog from the cover of Signals sits looking up at the covers, and the pushbroom used by the janitor on the cover of the Gold compilation rests against the wall near him. (The dog appears on the Gold cover as well.)\nContent\n\nThis is the only Retrospective collection to feature live material, in the form of the song &quot;Ghost Of A Chance (Live)&quot;. This version is notable for not being previously available on any other Rush release. It also feature remixes of the two tracks from Vapor Trails, done to correct mastering problems associated with the album. \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;One Little Victory (remix)&quot; - 5:11\n    &quot;Dreamline&quot; - 4:39\n    &quot;Workin' Them Angels&quot; - 4:48\n    &quot;Presto&quot; - 5:48\n    &quot;Bravado&quot; - 4:38\n    &quot;Driven&quot; - 4:29\n    &quot;The Pass&quot; - 4:53\n    &quot;Animate&quot; - 6:05\n    &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; - 5:32\n    &quot;Ghost of a Chance (live)&quot; - 5:51\n    &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot; - 4:56\n    &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot; - 4:08\n    &quot;Earthshine (remix)&quot; - 5:38\n    &quot;Far Cry&quot; - 5:18\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b3477b6e34cb853d2bb5086c9bd83ac714616f","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Retrospective+III+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b3477b6e34cb853d2bb5086c9bd83ac714616f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,179,71,123,110,52,203,133,61,43,181,8,108,155,216,58,199,20,97,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
