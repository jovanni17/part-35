As the opposing forces separate into two camps - one led by the saintly Mother Abigail and the other demonic Randall Flagg - the noble elements try to shield themselves from their corrupt enemy, whose ruthless potency is increased by their domination of an excavated nuclear warhead. Their extreme clash of wills makes it inevitable that these remnants of humanity will soon engage in a final confrontation - The Stand - an immense and atrocious battle which could result in annihilating the power of good and hurdle the fate of the planet into the reins of evil.\nThe episodes motion picture, adapted for the screen by Stephen King himself, brings to life King&amp;#039;s terrifying epic featuring an all-star powered cast including Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Jamey Sheridan, Laura San Giacomo, Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, Kareem Adul-Jabbar and Rob Lowe as &quot;Nick Andros.&quot;\n\nMore details: www.solodvd.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf7d3ab2f0a039836e9624b87b13b44023de6e0a","amp;dn":"The+Stand+Miniserie+Stephen+King+2DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf7d3ab2f0a039836e9624b87b13b44023de6e0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,125,58,178,240,160,57,131,110,150,36,184,123,19,180,64,35,222,110,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
