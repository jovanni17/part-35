While Grell wrote and did all the covers, he stopped drawing the stories after #44. Late in this run Grell announced in the comic's own text pages that Tony DeZuniga would soon join him as the new artist. Just what happened to these plans is unclear, but soon the series was suspended, and after a few months, Marv Wolfman was writing and Bill Jaaska was drawing a new series called Sable, with Grell having no part. This lasted 27 issues before cancellation. Marv Wolfman abruptly left the series after issue #23 and comic book fan Steve Kaye took over the writing chores for the final four issues. Fan favorite artist Tim Vigil provided covers for the remaining issues. ------ Wikipedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f73d34ffd795d1a0d71d682237ee6b02d1a4b4","amp;dn":"Sable+19-27+ctc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f73d34ffd795d1a0d71d682237ee6b02d1a4b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,247,61,52,255,215,149,209,160,215,29,104,34,55,238,107,2,209,164,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
