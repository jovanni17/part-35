Sell By Date [Scarlett Bernard, #0.5] - Melissa F. Olson\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\nThis prequel story takes us back to the first meeting between crime scene cleaner and null Scarlett Bernard and her roommate Molly, a vampire with a complicated past and an even more complicated motive for inviting Scarlett into her home. Here, for the first time, read the story of Molly and Scarlett's first meeting - from Molly's point of view. (This short story takes place prior to the beginning of Dead Spots.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n02. Dead Spots [Scarlett Bernard, #1] - Melissa F. Olson\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\nScarlett Bernard knows about personal space: step within ten feet of her, and any supernatural spells or demonic forces are instantly defusedâ€”vampires and werewolves become human again, and witches canâ€™t get out so much as a â€œhocus pocus.â€ This special skill makes her a null and very valuable to Los Angelesâ€™s three most powerful magical communities, who utilize her ability to scrub crime scenes clean of all traces of the paranormal to keep humanity, and the LAPD, in the dark.\r\n\r\nBut one night Scarlettâ€™s late arrival to a grisly murder scene reveals her agenda and ends with LAPDâ€™s Jesse Cruz tracking her down to strike a deal: heâ€™ll keep quiet about the undead underworld if she helps solve the case. Their pact doesnâ€™t sit well with Dash, the cityâ€™s chief bloodsucker, who fears his whole vampire empire is at stake. And when clues start to point to Scarlett, itâ€™ll take more than her unique powers to catch the real killer and clear her name.\r\n\r\n03. Trail of Dead [Scarlett Bernard, #2] - Melissa F. Olson\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\nAs a null, Scarlett Bernard possesses a rare ability to counteract the supernatural by instantly neutralizing spells and magical forces. For years she has used her gift to scrub crime scenes of any magical traces, helping the powerful paranormal communities of Los Angeles stay hidden. But after LAPD detective Jesse Cruz discovered Scarlettâ€™s secret, he made a bargain with her: solve a particularly grisly murder case, and he would stay silent about the cityâ€™s unearthly underworld.\r\n\r\nNow two dead witches are found a few days before Christmas, and Scarlett is once again strong-armed into assisting the investigation. She soon finds a connection between the murders and her own former mentor, Olivia, a null who mysteriously turned into a vampire and who harbors her own sinister agenda. Now Scarlett must revisit her painful past to find Oliviaâ€”unless the blood-drenched present claims her life first.\r\n\r\n04. Hunter's Trail [Scarlett Bernard, #3] - Melissa F. Olson\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\nActions have consequencesâ€”a lesson Scarlett Bernard is learning the hard way. As a â€œnull,â€ Scarlett has always been able to negate the powers of the supernatural beings that surround her. But now her reckless decision to permanently change Eli from a werewolf to a human has left the Los Angeles werewolf pack in shambles, and upset the balance of power among the cityâ€™s supernatural factions. To make matters worse, Scarlettâ€™s employers discover that a newly changed werewolf is running amok in the city. To catch the rogue werewolf, Scarlett will need help from both Eli and Detective Jesse Cruz of the LAPDâ€¦a situation that will force her to finally choose between them.\r\n\r\nHowever, Scarlett and her friends arenâ€™t the only ones on the huntâ€”someone else is chasing the wolf. Someone with no reservations about collateral damage. Now Scarlett and her allies must stop both the rogue wolf and the deadly hunter before the full moon rises and all hell breaks loose.\r\n\r\nFilled with the same suspense and wit readers loved in Dead Spots and Trail of Dead, this may be Scarlett Bernardâ€™s most harrowing adventure yetâ€¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406911cfbe1a4e5f998b98f4795b723f29f68e05","amp;dn":"Scarlett+Bernard+Series+-+Melissa+F.+Olson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406911cfbe1a4e5f998b98f4795b723f29f68e05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,105,17,207,190,26,78,95,153,139,152,244,121,91,114,63,41,246,142,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
