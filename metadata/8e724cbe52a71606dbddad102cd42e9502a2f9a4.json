They funnel money from the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign &quot;aid&quot; organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy families who control the planet's natural resources. Their tools included fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex, and murder. They play a game as old as empire, but one that has taken on new and terrifying dimensions during this time of globalization.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e724cbe52a71606dbddad102cd42e9502a2f9a4","amp;dn":"Confessions+of+an+Economic+Hitman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e724cbe52a71606dbddad102cd42e9502a2f9a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,114,76,190,82,167,22,6,219,221,173,16,44,212,46,149,2,162,249,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
