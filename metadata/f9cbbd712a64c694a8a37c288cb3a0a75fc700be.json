How did he end up this way? In an astonishing debut, Aman Sethi brings him and his indelible group of friends to life through their adventures and misfortunes in the Old Delhi Railway Station, the harrowing wards of a tuberculosis hospital, an illegal bar made of cardboard and plywood, and into Beggars Court and back onto the streets.\n\nIn a time of global economic strain, this is an unforgettable evocation of persistence in the face of poverty in one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest cities. Sethi recounts AshrafÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprising life story with wit, candor, and verve, and A Free Man becomes a moving story of the many ways a man can be free.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9cbbd712a64c694a8a37c288cb3a0a75fc700be","amp;dn":"A+Free+Man+-+Aman+Sethi.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9cbbd712a64c694a8a37c288cb3a0a75fc700be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,203,189,113,42,100,198,148,168,163,124,40,140,179,160,167,95,199,0,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
