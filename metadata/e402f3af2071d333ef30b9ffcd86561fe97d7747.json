The great actor is brilliantly showcased in a drama that follows Darrow's reflections on his life, his passions, his personal disappointments and his professional triumphs.\n\nThe DVD is from Kultur films (http://estore.websitepros.com/1652646/Detail.bok?no=172) which has the largest collection of filmed theater performances of which I am aware. Those having a love of live theater ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from Drama to Musicals to Opera ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ would be well advised to visit their website and peruse the dozens of filmed live performances they have available. Additionally, many are available from Netflix.\n\nHenry Jaynes Fonda (May 16, 1905 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ August 12, 1982) was an American film and stage actor, best known for his roles as plain-speaking idealists. Fonda's subtle, naturalistic acting style preceded by many years the popularization of method acting.\nFonda made his mark early as a Broadway actor, and made his Hollywood debut in 1935. Fonda's career gained momentum after his Academy Award-nominated performance as Tom Joad in 1940's The Grapes of Wrath, an adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel about an Oklahoma family who moved west during the Dust Bowl. Throughout six decades in Hollywood, Fonda cultivated a strong, appealing screen image in such classics as The Ox-Bow Incident, Mister Roberts and 12 Angry Men. Later, Fonda moved toward both more challenging, darker epics as Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (portraying a villain who kills, among others, a child) and lighter roles in family comedies like Yours, Mine and Ours with Lucille Ball.\nFonda was the patriarch of a family of famous actors, including daughter Jane Fonda, son Peter Fonda, granddaughter Bridget Fonda, and grandson Troy Garity; his family and close friends called him &quot;Hank&quot;. In 1999, he was named the sixth Greatest Male Star of All Time by the American Film Institute.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Darrow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Darrow&lt;/a&gt;\n\nClarence Seward Darrow (April 18, 1857 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ March 13, 1938) was an American lawyer and leading member of the American Civil Liberties Union, best known for defending teenage thrill killers Leopold and Loeb in their trial for murdering 14-year-old Bobby Franks (1924) and defending John T. Scopes in the so-called &quot;Monkey&quot; Trial (1925), in which he opposed William Jennings Bryan (statesman, noted orator, and three time presidential candidate for the Democratic Party). Called a &quot;sophisticated country lawyer&quot;,[1] he remains notable for his wit and agnosticism that marked him as one of the most famous American lawyers and civil libertarians.[2]\n\n***NOTE*** - Those new to the famous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMonkey TrialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will enjoy the classic fictionalized version INHERIT THE WIND - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053946/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e402f3af2071d333ef30b9ffcd86561fe97d7747","amp;dn":"Live+On+Broadway+-+Henry+Fonda+as+Clarence+Darrow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e402f3af2071d333ef30b9ffcd86561fe97d7747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,2,243,175,32,113,211,51,239,48,185,255,205,134,86,31,233,125,119,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
