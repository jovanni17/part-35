While her two brothers dive into a life of gangland violence, Ruby has to work in their family store. As she blossoms into a beautiful young woman she crosses paths with aristocrat Cornelius Bray, a chance meeting that will change her life forever. When she finds herself pregnant, and then has twins, she is forced to give her children away. At that point she vows never to trust another man again. As the years pass, Ruby never forgets her babies, and as the family store turns into a retail empire, Ruby wants her children back. But secrets were whispered and bargains made, and if Ruby wants to stay alive she needs to forget the past, or the past will come back and kill her.\n\n \n                               Format 1 - Epub\n\n                               Format 2 - Mobi\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ab718a496be8dfe046a7d60e392a3428f325464","amp;dn":"Nameless+by+Jessie+Keane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ab718a496be8dfe046a7d60e392a3428f325464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,183,24,164,150,190,141,254,4,106,125,96,227,146,163,66,143,50,84,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
