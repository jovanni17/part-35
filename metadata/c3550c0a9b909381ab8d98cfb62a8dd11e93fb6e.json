It was released on April 30, 2000 in North America and May 9, 2000 in Europe.\n\nSimilar to the first game, the player is set to defeat monsters in order to foil Zarok's evil plans again. This sequel also contains several new characters and an entire new range of levels set in 19th Century London. However, it still follows similar beasts, demons, traps and encounters with bosses as before. The exact date of the game's setting is unknown, however the year is defined as 1886 AD, 500 years after Sir Daniel Fortesque was laid to rest.\n\nit defends whole image of (offense of) game in polish version Medievil 2 .\nIt translate\n- all dialog screens\n- whole diagram (graphic artist; graphics) ( wczytywanie, end of game etc. )\n- all book - menu\n- location it defends it\n- name so - padded all voice (, has polish it game audio; ] )\n\nLanguage: Polish\nSize: 294MB\nRegion: PAL\nFormat: Iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3550c0a9b909381ab8d98cfb62a8dd11e93fb6e","amp;dn":"PS1+Medievil+2+%5BPolish%5D+%5BPAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3550c0a9b909381ab8d98cfb62a8dd11e93fb6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,85,12,10,155,144,147,129,171,141,152,207,182,42,141,209,30,147,251,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
