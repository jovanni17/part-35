It was first published in the August 19, 1843, edition of The Saturday Evening Post. It is a study of the psychology of guilt, often paired in analysis with PoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Tell-Tale HeartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.[1] In both, a murderer carefully conceals his crime and believes himself unassailable, but eventually breaks down and reveals himself, impelled by a nagging reminder of his guilt.\n\nwikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Cat_(short_story)\n\nFor more ebook downloads visit www.opencast.de\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c169890f75e6ebc8f81ee64e56350420815811","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+The+Black+cat+by+Edgar+Allan+Poe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c169890f75e6ebc8f81ee64e56350420815811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,193,105,137,15,117,230,235,200,248,30,230,78,86,53,4,32,129,88,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
