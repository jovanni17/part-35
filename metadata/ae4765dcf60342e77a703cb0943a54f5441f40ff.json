Proven Cloud-based technology automatically stops Viruses &amp; Spyware before they reach your computer - itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a whole new way to protect your PC.\n\nFeatures Of Titanium Maximum Security:\n\nSPAM-BLOCKER\nFinds and blocks annoying and dangerous junk email and image spams. The real-time spam detection provides immediate protection from outbreaks.\n\nREAL-TIME UPDATES\nSafeguard you from the latest on-line threats today and in the future. Titanium Maximum Security leverages Trend MicroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Smart Protection NetworkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ plus real-time antivirus scanning to provide always-on-guard protection keeping you safe from latest, ever-evolving malware threats.\n\nPARENTAL CONTROLS\nProtect your children from inappropriate websites, limit their time on the Internet, and see detailed reports about what they do online, without having to look over their shoulders.\n\nDATA THEFT PREVENTION\nPrevent hackers and spyware from stealing credit card numbers, passwords, email addresses, and other sensitive data.\n\nStop protected data from going into web pages, email messages or instant messaging. Use the pre-defined categories or set new ones of your own. Putting just part of a word or number into the Data Theft Prevention list can still protect the whole thing. For example, entering just the last four digits or your credit card can block spyware from getting the entire number.\n\nTREND MICRO VAULT\nA password protected folder that can safeguard your sensitive files. If your computer is lost or stolen, you can remotely lock this vault to keep these files safe.\n\nSECURE ERASE\nDeleting a file just removes the directory information used to find it, but not the actual data. Secure Erase overwrites deleted files with random data, so that the contents canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be retrieved.\n\nSYSTEM TUNER\nRecover disk space, make MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® start faster, clean out your instant messaging history, and optimise your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance. Schedule automatic tune-ups to keep your PC running smoothly.\n\nLIGHT ON SYSTEM RESOURCES\nTitanium is powered by Trend MicroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Smart Protection NetworkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ which gathers and analyses threat data, blocking viruses and other malware BEFORE they can reach your PC. Because the processing is done ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin the cloudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Titanium uses less of your PCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memory and disk space, so it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t slow you down.\n\nDETAILED SECURITY REPORTS\nEasy to read graphic reports provide you with all the details about the threats that attack your computer. You can drill down into detailed logs with just one click.\n\nFREE TOOLS\nThe Titanium Maximum Tool Centre displays a page of shortcuts so you can easily access and manage features such as Parental Controls, System Tuner, Secure Erase and more.
