This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nBecause of the Vietnam War draft, 1972 was to be the first presidential election where 18 to 20 year-old Americans were eligible to vote. Casey encourages voter registration in each hour of the show.\n\nTwo songs debut so high in the top 40 that they are in the second hour of the show: &quot;Baby Blue&quot; by Badfinger (at number 26) and &quot;Doctor My Eyes&quot; by Jackson Browne (at number 24).\n\nA listener wants to know what artist or group has had the most number one albums. Casey says this group has 14 number one albums in a span of just six years.\n\nThere is a song that Casey says was banned in Ireland at the time.\n\nCasey gets a letter which asks, &quot;What was the most controversial song ever to become a hit?&quot; Without answering directly, he recalls some songs about insanity, Vietnam atrocities, suicide, and cannibalism.\n\n40: King Heroin - James Brown\n39: Take A Look Around - The Temptations\n38: Help Me Make It Through The Night - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n37: Ain't Understanding Mellow - Jerry Butler and Brenda Lee Egger\n36: Got To Get It On Again - The Adrisi Brothers\n35: Slippin' Into Darkness - War\n34: Let It On (Get It On) - T-Rex\n33: Look What You Done For Me - Al Green\n32: Jump Into The Fire - Nilsson\n31: Precious And Few - Climax\n30: Do Your Thing - Isaac Hayes\n29: Suavecito - Malo\n28: Every Day Of My Life - Bobby Vinton\n27: Family Of Man - Three Dog Night\n26: Baby Blue - Badfinger\n25: Vincent - Don Mclean\n24: Doctor My Eyes - Jackson Browne\n23: I Day I Found Myself - Honeycone\n22: Crazy Mama - J.J.
