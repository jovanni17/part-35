He has bad eyesight, a pure heart, and a secret crush on the store manager, Rokka. Unfortunately for him, Rokka swore off love 8 years ago. But when Ryosuke goes up to her apartment on the second floor, he runs into a good-looking half-naked man. At first upset, he learns that this isn't Rokka's live-in boyfriend; he's the ghost of her late husband, Atsushi. She can't see him, and Ryosuke decides not to give up on her, even with a dead husband standing in the way.\n\n\n\n\nStatus: Finished Airing\n\n\nGenres: Drama, Romance, Supernatural, Josei\n\n\nDuration: 24 min. per episode\n\n\nRating: PG-13 - Teens 13 or older\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\nAired: Jul 6, 2012 to Sep 14, 2012\n\n\nSubTitle language : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:488980801a2eae95d6e0a8679c017eab35ba53c1","amp;dn":"%5BWhyNot%5D+Natsuyuki+Rendezvous+%5BTV+720p+AAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"488980801a2eae95d6e0a8679c017eab35ba53c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,137,128,128,26,46,174,149,214,224,168,103,156,1,126,171,53,186,83,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
