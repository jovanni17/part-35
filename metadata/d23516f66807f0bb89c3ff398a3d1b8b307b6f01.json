ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an intriguing yet hilarious tale, full of betrayal, ambition, and love. Like the family it depicts, the show's creative forces have been riven by dysfunction from the get-goÃ¢â‚¬â€outsize egos clashing with studio executives and one another over credit for and control of a pop-culture institution. Contrary to popular belief, The Simpsons did not spring out of one man's brain, fully formed, like a hilarious Athena. Its inception was a process, with many parents, and this book tells the story.\n\n\n20 files, MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d23516f66807f0bb89c3ff398a3d1b8b307b6f01","amp;dn":"The+Simpsons+-+An+Uncensored%2C+Unauthorized+History+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d23516f66807f0bb89c3ff398a3d1b8b307b6f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,53,22,246,104,7,240,187,137,195,255,57,138,61,27,139,48,123,111,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
