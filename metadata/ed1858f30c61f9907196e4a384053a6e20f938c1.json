We dip into this sea more often than we realize, sprinkling our writings and everyday conversations with words and phrases that are derived from other languages. This reference presents information on the origins and usage of more than 4000 of these expressions. The dictionary clarifies and explains words and phrases spanning a wide range of fields, from law to music, philosophy to cuisine. Some expressions have been fully assimilated into the English language, including &quot;igloo&quot;, &quot;extra&quot; and &quot;bonanza&quot;, while others are still considered foreign, such as &quot;de rigueur&quot; and &quot;magnum opus&quot;. Entries include pronunciations in American English, parts of speech and other relevant grammatical information, languages of origin, concise definitions, examples of use and etymological backgrounds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed1858f30c61f9907196e4a384053a6e20f938c1","amp;dn":"The+Facts+On+File+Dictionary+of+Foreign+Words+and+Phrases+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed1858f30c61f9907196e4a384053a6e20f938c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,24,88,243,12,97,249,144,113,150,228,163,132,5,58,110,32,249,56,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
