The microsystems field has expanded to embrace a host of technologies, and microelectronics has now been joined by micro-mechanics, micro-fluidics and micro-optics to allow the fabrication of complex, multi- functional integrated microsystems. At over 2000 pages, Comprehensive Microsystems represents the authoritative primary reference source on microsystems. It addresses the need for an overview of the technologies and capabilities available in this highly interdisciplinary and dynamically-growing engineering field. \nComprehensive Microsystems, provides an exhaustive overview of the wide range of topics which comprise the microsystems field, including, design and materials, fabrication and packaging, optical systems, chemical and biological systems, physical sensors, actuation, electronics for MEMS and industrial applications. Every article in the work has been commissioned by a panel of internationally recognized editors and written by an acknowledged expert in any one of a variety of disciplines. The articles provide a concise overview of a particular aspect of the microsystems field and are accompanied by extensive bibliographies, cross-referencing and indexes, enhancing the value of the text. by guiding the user to the most relevant further reading within the ever-expanding available literature. Much care has been given to avoid overlap and to provide consistency in style and contents. \n\n* The first and foremost comprehensive reference on Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) \n* Unifies established research from recognized sources in an easily accessible format \n* Provides an essential reference source for both academics and professionals in the field \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d23cb4af06eb44082dc75020dcf55df1f7c329","amp;dn":"Comprehensive+Microsystems%2C+Three-Volume+Set%2C+Volume+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d23cb4af06eb44082dc75020dcf55df1f7c329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,210,60,180,175,6,235,68,8,45,199,80,32,220,245,93,241,247,195,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
