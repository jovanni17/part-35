Fans of the Swedish sound should not miss as long a bit more volume is okay with them. An excellent debut and full of loud, but purely poppy tunes. Very Highly Recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1bec662579265eb7ddca82a1da816584ebf1266","amp;dn":"Carpe+Wade+-+Odd+Man+Out+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1bec662579265eb7ddca82a1da816584ebf1266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,190,198,98,87,146,101,235,125,220,168,42,29,168,22,88,78,191,18,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
