Nonetheless, thirty years after his first trip to the Mideast, former President Jimmy Carter still has hope for a peaceful, comprehensive solution to the region&amp;#039;s troubles, delivering this informed and readable chronicle as an offering to the cause. An engineer of the 1978 Camp David Accords and 2002 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Carter would seem to be a perfect emissary in the Middle East, an impartial and uniting diplomatic force in a fractured land. Not entirely so. Throughout his work, Carter assigns ultimate blame to Israel, arguing that the country&amp;#039;s leadership has routinely undermined the peace process through its obstinate, aggressive and illegal occupation of territories seized in 1967. He&amp;#039;s decidedly less critical of Arab leaders, accepting their concern for the Palestinian cause at face value, and including their anti-Israel rhetoric as a matter of course, without much in the way of counter-argument. Carter&amp;#039;s book provides a fine overview for those unfamiliar with the history of the conflict and lays out an internationally accepted blueprint for peace.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd8163c2b37319d54032362e2015d1bde8649eba","amp;dn":"Palestine+Peace+Not+Apartheid+-+Jimmy+Carter+%28Israel+-+Middle+Ea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd8163c2b37319d54032362e2015d1bde8649eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,129,99,194,179,115,25,213,64,50,54,46,32,21,209,189,232,100,158,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
