What  \n                    lies behind the door of number 27 The Hill? A  \n                    routine 'domestic' call out to the house leads  \n                    to a policeman's murder, the prime suspect  \n                    grievously injured and a shocking discovery  \n                    made. For DCI Alan Banks it is the most  \n                    difficult case of his life. Five young girls  \n                    have gone missing and he has just discovered  \n                    the lair of a serial rapist and killer but only  \n                    four bodies are found. Which means one, Leanne  \n                    Wray, could still be alive... But the suspect  \n                    Marcus Payne is in a coma, and the ambitious DS  \n                    Annie Cabbot from Professional Standards wants  \n                    to know why. As Banks pursues his line of  \n                    investigation, she tails him every step of the  \n                    way.                                     \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27a60cbbdfc2f89c56a6f3c868df5aee8f407db7","amp;dn":"DCI.Banks.Aftermath.Part1.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27a60cbbdfc2f89c56a6f3c868df5aee8f407db7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,166,12,187,223,194,248,156,86,166,243,200,104,223,90,238,143,64,125,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
