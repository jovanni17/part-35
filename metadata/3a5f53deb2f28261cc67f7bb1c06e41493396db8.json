What           \n        we do know however, from a historical context, is            \n        that in 1990, Disney and Henson were finalizing a            \n        merger. Jim wanted to spend more time on his creative        \n        projects and less time managing a company, and Disney        \n        had certainly been showing a keen interest for some          \n        time. Quite a change from almost a decade before,            \n        when Disney had been in financial trouble, unable            \n        to live up to their earlier success, and Jim and             \n        his life-long agent Bernie Brillstein were in                \n        discussions to buy Disney! This would really have            \n        turned around the then long-lived misconception that         \n        Disney owned The Muppets (which since 2004 is actually       \n        true), but eventually fell through for several               \n        reasons, among them that Jim was not willing to              \n        surrender control of Sesame Street to Disney.                \n                                                                     \n          In 1989-90, under new management of Michael Eisner,        \n        the deal looked very much set to happen, though the          \n        other way around. Many collaborations were produced          \n        and planned, and it was widely believed that had Jim         \n        not died in the middle of negotiations, the deal would       \n        have gone through, and the Henson company would cease        \n        to exist in any of its many incarnations. It's hard          \n        to say what effect this would have had on either             \n        company, but suffice to say it would have impacted           \n        Muppets, Fraggles and the rest of the Muppet universe        \n        in a very big way.                                           \n                                                                     \n          This interview, which appears to have been an              \n        internal production copyrighted in 1990, must have           \n        been only months before Jim's death, and in the              \n        middle of their negotiations. Its exact purpose is           \n        unclear, but one might speculate it was perhaps              \n        made to introduce key Henson staff to internals at           \n        Disney. Jim and Frank should be familiar names by            \n        now, and Michael K. Frith was at the time their              \n        creative director after a long career of designing           \n        Muppets and other creatures. Where Don Sahlin both           \n        designed and built Muppets, Michael was always               \n        content letting others do the building. After                \n        leaving Henson in 1996, he's stayed with puppetry,           \n        and like Craig Shemin married a Muppeteer (Kathryn           \n        Mullen, performer of Mokey Fraggle, Kira in The              \n        Dark Crystal and many others).                               \n                                          Enjoy!                     \n                                                                     \n                                               \n                                             \n                                               \n                    \n                \n                         \n                               \n                                               \n                                                                     \n                              ~HO HO HO~                             \n                                                                    \n                                                              \n                 For the month of December we've decided to     \n                do something special.
