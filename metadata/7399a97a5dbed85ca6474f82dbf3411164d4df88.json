Repelled by her uneducated and sometimes violent husband, delicate Gertrude devotes her life to her children, especially to her sons, William and Paul - determined they will not follow their father into working down the coal mines. But conflict is evitable when Paul seeks to escape from his mother's suffocating grasp through relationships with women his own age. \n\nSet in Lawrence's native Nottinghamshire, 'Sons and Lovers' (1913) is a highly autobiographical and compelling portrayal of childhood, adolescence and the clash of generations. D H Lawrence showed himself as adept as Thomas Hardy was in portraying the harsh realities of rural life in the late 19th, early 20th century.\n\nDavid Herbert Lawrence (1885-1930) English novelist, story writer, critic, poet and painter, is one of the greatest figures of 20th-century English literature. Among his works are The White Peacock (1911), Sons and Lovers (1913), The Rainbow (1915) and Lady Chatterly's Lover, first published privately in Florence in 1928. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7399a97a5dbed85ca6474f82dbf3411164d4df88","amp;dn":"D+H+Lawrence+-+Sons+and+Lovers+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7399a97a5dbed85ca6474f82dbf3411164d4df88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,153,169,122,93,190,216,92,166,71,79,130,219,243,65,17,100,212,223,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
