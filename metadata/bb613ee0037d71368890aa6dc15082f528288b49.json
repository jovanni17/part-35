The game offers the same easy to play excitement as before, but now with much more accurate tracking of your body. That makes it even easier to judge your performance and give tips on where you might be going wrong.\n\nThe basics are the same as ever though: just hold the Wii remote and nunchuck and try and copy the moves shown on screen. Each song has its own special routine and you can sing along as well if you want, with the onscreen lyrics.\n\nYou don't have to just dance on your own though - the whole point is having fun with friends and that's easier than ever with new duet, co-op and competitive game modes. It doesn't matter how good or bad you think you are, Just Dance is fun for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb613ee0037d71368890aa6dc15082f528288b49","amp;dn":"Just+Dance+2%5BSD2P41%5D%5BPAL%5D.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb613ee0037d71368890aa6dc15082f528288b49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,97,62,224,3,125,113,54,136,144,170,109,193,80,130,245,40,40,139,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
