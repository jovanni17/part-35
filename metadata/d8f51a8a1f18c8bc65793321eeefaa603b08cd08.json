GurrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a, Luna and ResÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ndiz take the listener on a journey that blurs the arbitrary boundaries separating classical, traditional, contemporary and experimental music. Ethos creates contrasting and dramatic music through textures that takes the audience from static to cinematic mood. Its music evokes dynamism, and its compositions, reinvent the group's sound on each recording.\n\nwma 64kbps\n\n\n01 All the thigs\n02 Sammarkanda\n03 Ethos\n04 Air\n05 Straight no chaser\n06 sister's wings\n07 my favorite things\n08 amnios\n09 worm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f51a8a1f18c8bc65793321eeefaa603b08cd08","amp;dn":"Ethos+-+Jazz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f51a8a1f18c8bc65793321eeefaa603b08cd08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,245,26,138,31,24,200,188,101,121,51,33,238,239,170,96,59,8,205,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
