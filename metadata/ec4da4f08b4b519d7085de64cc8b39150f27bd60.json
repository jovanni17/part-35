An object lesson in fitting great songwriting into experimental production and genre play, this is also a record whose influence extends far beyond mere they-was-the-greatest cheerleading. Putting McCartney's more traditionally melodic &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; and &quot;For No One&quot; alongside Lennon's direct-hit sneering (&quot;Dr. Robert&quot;) and dreamscapes (&quot;I'm Only Sleeping,&quot; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;) and Harrison's peaking wit (&quot;Taxman&quot;) was as conceptually brilliant as anything Sgt. Pepper attempted, and\nmore subtly fulfilling. A must. --Rickey Wright\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Taxman                                               [02:39]\n02.Eleanor rigby                                        [02:07]\n03.I'm only sleeping                                    [03:00]\n04.Love you to                                          [03:00]\n05.Here, there and everywhere                           [02:25]\n06.Yellow submarine                                     [02:39]\n07.She said she said                                    [02:36]\n08.Good day sunshine                                    [02:09]\n09.And your bird can sing                               [02:01]\n10.For no one                                           [02:00]\n11.Doctor robert                                        [02:14]\n12.I want to tell you                                   [02:28]\n13.Got to get you into my life                          [02:29]\n14.Tomorrow never knows                                 [03:00]\n____\n\n34:47 min\n 51,9 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
