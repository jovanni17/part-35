Ram and Rahim were two different characters \nplaying role of secret agents.\nIn most of the stories their job will be to save the world from a wicked scientist\nor an enemy of their nation. A typical story will feature their mission to bring \nback a stolen secret file from the villain\\\\\\'s den, before it reaches the enemy nation.\nThe choice of character\\\\\\'s name as Ram and Rahim was also contributing towards religious\nharmony among children. According to one volume namely Vatann ke Dushman Rahim is \nthe son of a Pakistani colonel who defected to India after he got disillusioned by \nfanaticism of Pakistani armed forces, especially an officer named Fanneh Khan. \nRam is the eldest son of a highly placed Indian Intelligence beaurecrat.\nRam is a Hindu name while Rahim is a Muslim name. Both will have tremendous friendship \nand both will work together to save the world.\nThey have a enemy named Dr. Fomanchu.\nIn later stories, Rahim loses his one hand and has to make do with a prosthetic arm \nthat has the same capabilities as a normal hand, but much stronger and faster.\nChildren used to wait for summer holidays in the late 80s and early 90s for special \neditions of Ram-Rahim\\\\\\'s and Crookbond\\\\\\'s comics during summer holidays.\n\nCOMICS LIST:\n\n013 Maut Bechne Wale.pdf\t23.20 MB\n014 Kanoon Ka Shikanja.pdf\t23.02 MB\n015 Sirfira Vaigyanik.pdf\t20.58 MB\n016 Vinash Ke Badal.pdf\t20.60 MB\n017 Vishwa Samrat Black Dragon.pdf\t21.18 MB\n018 Bhatakti Aatma.pdf\t7.81 MB\n019 Aatma Ka Pratishodh.pdf\t19.85 MB\n020 Khooni Haveli.pdf\t18.83 MB\n021 Apne Desh Ke Gaddar.pdf\t10.27 MB\n022 Hawa Ke Bete.pdf\t13.54 MB\n023 Bomb Ke Gole.pdf\t12.37 MB\n024 Tiranga Nahi Jhukega.pdf\t8.82 MB\n025 Aag Ka Tuffan.pdf\t12.94 MB\n\n\nTHANKS TO THE ORIGINAL UPLOADERS.\nPLEASE COMMENT IF YOU LIKE THEM.\nAND ALSO REMEMBER TO SEED AND HELP THE NEEDFUL.\nTHANKS\n-SANJEET","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:258b14fbd0647e82b3f72a2870eba5baf41649d8","amp;dn":"+MANOJ+COMICS+%28HINDI%29+RAM-RAHIM+SET-02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"258b14fbd0647e82b3f72a2870eba5baf41649d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,139,20,251,208,100,126,130,179,247,42,40,112,235,165,186,244,22,73,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
