A young girl named Temple is on the run. Haunted by her past and pursued by a killer, Temple is surrounded by death and danger, hoping to be set free.\n\nFor twenty-five years, civilization has survived in meager enclaves, guarded against a plague of the dead. Temple wanders this blighted landscape, keeping to herself and keeping her demons inside her heart. She can't remember a time before the zombies, but she does remember an old man who took her in and the younger brother she cared for until the tragedy that set her on a personal journey toward redemption. Moving back and forth between the insulated remnants of society and the brutal frontier beyond, Temple must decide where ultimately to make a home and find the salvation she seeks.\n------------------------------------------------\nNarrator: Tai Sammons\nListening Length:  7 hours and 25 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio\nAudible.com Release Date: August 3, 2010\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B003YV5BAG\n----------------\n\nHaven't listened to it yet but word is it's a cool zombie novel!\n\nGreetingz from Hollandia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48786f763e533eca9e0ddebfe2af6f96eeb4de4e","amp;dn":"Alden+Bell+-+The+Reapers+Are+The+Angels+%28Audiobooks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48786f763e533eca9e0ddebfe2af6f96eeb4de4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,120,111,118,62,83,62,202,158,13,222,191,226,175,111,150,238,180,222,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
