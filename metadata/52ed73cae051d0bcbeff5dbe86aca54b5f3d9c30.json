TOP FIVE digs under the surface of show business, politics, rap, and the exigencies of being black and famous todayÃƒâ€˜holding it all up to the light in the way only Chris Rock can. Mingling echoes of Woody Allen and Dick Gregory with the energy of Kanye West and Jay Z, TOP FIVE is an original and radically new kind of American movie.\n\nDirector: Chris Rock\n\nWriters: Chris Rock\n\nActors: Chris Rock, Rosario Dawson, Kevin Hart, Tracy Morgan, Cedric The Entertainer, JB Smoove, Sherri Shepherd, Anders Holm, Romany Malco, Leslie Jones\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 41 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52ed73cae051d0bcbeff5dbe86aca54b5f3d9c30","amp;dn":"Top+Five.+Official+Movie+Featurette+%5BHD%5D+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52ed73cae051d0bcbeff5dbe86aca54b5f3d9c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,237,115,202,224,81,208,188,190,255,93,190,134,172,165,75,95,61,156,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
