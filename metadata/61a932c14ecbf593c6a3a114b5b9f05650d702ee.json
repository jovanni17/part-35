In many newspaper articles, he demonstrated weak points in Islamic ideology.[1] Among other things he exposed Egypt's most popular preacher, Abd al-Hamid Kishk, for &quot;telling his audience that Muslims who entered paradise would enjoy eternal erections and the company of young boys draped in earrings and necklaces,&quot; and promising them &quot;an eternity of blissful pederasty.\n\nHe was shot to death in his office on 8 June 1992 by two Islamic fundamentalists from the Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya group. His son and other bystanders were seriously wounded in the attack.\n\nBefore his death, Farag Foda was declared an apostate and foe of Islam. An Al-Azhar scholar, Mohammed al-Ghazali, a witness before the court, declared it was not wrong to kill a foe of Islam. Al-Ghazali said: &quot;The killing of Farag Foda was in fact the implementation of the punishment against an apostate which the imam (the Islamic leader) has failed to implement (undertake).&quot;\nIts suspected that his assassination was executed after a Fatwa issued by the religious leaders of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and Omar Abdel-Rahman who was sentenced to life in prison in the United States in 1996.\nOne of Foda's killers, Abd al-Shafi Ahmad Ramadhan, was sentenced to death on 30 December 1993 and executed on 26 February 1994. The other was executed for another murder.\n\n\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤                                                                                Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ For more information and to discuss this book, please visit us in our group on Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ Facebook.
