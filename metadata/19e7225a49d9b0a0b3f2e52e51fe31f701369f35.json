Never knowing which direction the trip will take, I was listening to the my last Indie playlists.\n\nAt the end of a year one gets the urge to look back and close up. To round up the Dutch Treat part uptil the end of this year, I actually needed one more Playlist (dedicated to a unique source). Sometimes Music is like mining. Looking for the source.\n\nWhile thinking I happened to listen to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mother MotherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. More than Interesting music from an interesting titled Band. Reminds me of Klaatu (plus). Throughout my Indie collection, I happened to have several tracks (I would be happy to play for someone else too).\n\nSo, I could find four CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, from which Ã¢â‚¬Å“Touch UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is probably the best pick. A Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mother MotherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ special was born and to be honest, after listening it for the fifth time (why not, it only gets better) I was sure this is serious stuff that easily matches Porcupine Tree, Fink and even Florence.\n\nEnjoy (I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you to share, or not):\n\n\nDutch Treat - @40 Bit By Bit (Mother Mother)\n\n01 - Love It Dissipates\n02 - Little Pistol\n03 - Ball Cap\n04 - Dirty Town\n05 - Bit By Bit\n06 - The Stand\n07 - Miles\n08 - Little Hands\n09 - Verbatim\n10 - Love And Truth\n11 - Original Spin\n12 - Angry Sea\n13 - Oh Ana\n14 - Chasing It Down\n15 - Waiting For The World To End\n16 - Business Man\n17 - Train Of Thought\n18 - Polynesia\n19 - Neighbour\n20 - Wrecking Ball\n21 - Let's Fall In Love\n22 - Dread In My Heart\n23 - Infinitesimal\n24 - Body Of Yours\n25 - Hay Loft\n26 - Tic Toc\n27 - Calm Me Down\n28 - Had It All\n29 - Touch Up\n30 - Sleep Awake\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e7225a49d9b0a0b3f2e52e51fe31f701369f35","amp;dn":"Mother+Mother+-+Bit+By+Bit+%28Dutch+Treat+Indie+Special+%4040+HQ+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19e7225a49d9b0a0b3f2e52e51fe31f701369f35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,231,34,90,73,217,176,160,179,242,229,46,81,254,49,247,1,54,159,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
