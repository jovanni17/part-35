Recently, tales of these &quot;monsters&quot; have been corroborated by an increase in sightings, and out of these legends a new science has been born: cryptozoology -- the study of hidden animals.\nCryptozoology A to Z, the first encyclopedia of its kind, contains nearly two hundred entries, including cryptids (the name given to these unusual beasts), new animal finds, and the explorers and scientists who search for them. Loren Coleman, one of the world's leading cryptozoologists, teams up with Jerome Clark, editor and author of several encyclopedias, to provide these definitive descriptions and many never-before-published drawings and photographs from eyewitnesses' detailed accounts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75e870b6eca77f86f9d0ed526c067d12a92a18f7","amp;dn":"Cryptozoology+A+to+Z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75e870b6eca77f86f9d0ed526c067d12a92a18f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,232,112,182,236,167,127,134,249,208,237,82,108,6,125,18,169,42,24,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
