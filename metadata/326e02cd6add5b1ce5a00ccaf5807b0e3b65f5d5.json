That same year, Captured Tracks reissued Should's 1995 debut A Folding Sieve in an expanded form as the inaugural release of the label's Shoegaze Archive Series, which has since included reissues by Medicine and For Against.\n\nThroughout its 11 songs, The Great Pretend demonstrates that Should has flourished creatively in the interim. While still informed by their shoegaze and dream pop roots, the album twists and turns, subverting expectations.\n\nThe mono-chord, krautrock groove of the opener &quot;Don't Send Me your Regrets&quot; gives way to elegant, lush pop of &quot;Loveless Devotion&quot; - only to morph abruptly into an endless refrain atop heavy toms and buzzing guitars. The strident guitar and emphatic drums of &quot;Mistakes are Mine&quot; turns on a dime to an orchestrated, drumless bridge.\n\nBut the album is still stamped with Should's signatures: Marc Ostermeier and Tanya Maus' harmonies on &quot;In Monotone&quot; and &quot;A Lonely Place&quot; and the churning shoegaze wash of &quot;Dalliance,&quot; which harkens back to the band's debut and will no doubt be relished by longtime fans.\n\nThe starkest contrasting hues of Should's expanded songwriting palette lie between the unabashed Factory post-punk tones of &quot;Amends&quot; and &quot;Don't Get To Know Me,&quot; a 3/4-time piano vamp embellished with increasing layers of orchestration as the album closes. \n\nTracks\n1 don't send me your regrets [3.50] \n2 loveless devotion [4.11] \n3 mistakes are mine [4.40]\n4 in monotone [5.10]\n5 down a notch [3.16]\n6 everybody knows [4.12]\n7 dalliance [2.36]\n8 a lonely place [4.06]\n9 amends [3.49]\n10 gold stars [3.12]\n11 don't get to know me [4.02]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:326e02cd6add5b1ce5a00ccaf5807b0e3b65f5d5","amp;dn":"Should+-+The+Great+Pretend+%282014%29+%5BAlbum%5D%5BMP3+V0%5D%5BKely258%5D%5BP2PDL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"326e02cd6add5b1ce5a00ccaf5807b0e3b65f5d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,110,2,205,106,221,91,28,229,160,12,202,245,128,123,14,59,101,245,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
