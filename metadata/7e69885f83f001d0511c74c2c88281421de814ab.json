Only hours after she goes missing, Kim McDaniels's parents receive a terrifying phone call. Fearing the worst, they board the first flight to Maui and begin the hunt for their daughter.\n\n...WILL NEVER BE...\nEx-cop Ben Hawkins, now a reporter for the L.A. Times, gets the McDaniels assignment. The ineptitude of the local police force defies belief--Ben has to start his own investigation for Kim McDaniels to have a prayer. And for Ben to have the story of his life.\n\n...THE SAME FOR YOU AGAIN.\nAll the while, the killer sets the stage for his next production. His audience expects the best--and they won't be disappointed. Swimsuit is a heart-pounding story of fear and desire, transporting you to a place where beauty and murder collide and unspeakable horrors are hidden within paradise.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e69885f83f001d0511c74c2c88281421de814ab","amp;dn":"James+Patterson+-+Swimsuit+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e69885f83f001d0511c74c2c88281421de814ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,105,136,95,131,240,1,208,81,28,116,194,200,130,129,66,29,232,20,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
