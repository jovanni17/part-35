It was released August 2000 on Food, and spawned two singles: &quot;I (Friday Night)&quot; and &quot;The Self Same Thing&quot;. The single &quot;I (Friday Night) was released in the UK on May 1st. \n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Lucy O'Brien - Make It Better, Dubstar's third album, Newcastle masters of pop sound refreshed, lacing their sound with a new rhythmic drive. Steve Hillier (programming) and Chris Wilkie (guitar) create Saint Etienne-style beat pop, replete with lush harmonies and gentle electronica, while singer Sarah Blackwood (she of the double false eyelashes) sings pointed, perky lyrics about sex and the single girl. There's the optimistic Kirsty MacColl-ish single &quot;I (Friday Night)&quot;, and the punky ode to low self-esteem &quot;I'm Conscious Of Myself&quot;. It's not all pithy thoughts on romance, however. Dubstar even tackle communal suicide and mass destruction (phew!) on &quot;Arc Of Fire&quot; and astral travel on the intriguing, percussive track &quot;Mercury&quot;. After a few years in the doldrums, this is a return to form.  \n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Take It\n[02] I (Friday Night)\n[03] The Self Same Thing\n[04] Mercury\n[05] Stay\n[06] Another Word\n[07] When The World Knows Your Name\n[08] Arc Of Fire\n[09] Believe In Me\n[10] I'm Conscious Of Myself\n[11] Rise To The Top\n[12] Swansong\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:41m:29s\nTotal File Size    \t- 102mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\nMusic Video Format  \t - N / A\nScanned Artwork             - Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\nOriginally Released\t- 28 August 2000\nRecord Company\t\t- EMI Records\nArtists Website\t\t-  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dubstar.org.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dubstar.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstar&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n\n\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45d2fb25a616f54ed5d8fb556434430698a27499","amp;dn":"%5B2000%5D+Make+It+Better+-+Dubstar+-+102mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45d2fb25a616f54ed5d8fb556434430698a27499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,210,251,37,166,22,245,78,213,216,251,85,100,52,67,6,152,162,116,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
