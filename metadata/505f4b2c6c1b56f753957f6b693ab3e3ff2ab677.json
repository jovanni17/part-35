Sherwin VINE VOICE\n[quote]The Irish Tenors put out a grand album of wonderful holiday music! Finbar Wright, Anthony Kearns and Karl Scully are all in superb form throughout the album; and that's wonderful. This album is destined to become a classic; it's all that enjoyable! The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very nicely done.\n\nThe album begins with a wonderful rendition of &quot;Hark The Herald Angels Sing.&quot; The lush musical arrangement is stately and beautiful at once; and The Irish Tenors never miss a beat! They harmonize to perfection and it all makes &quot;Hark The Herald Angels Sing&quot; a very special number. The trio then performs &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; and it's terrific to hear them perform this--they never let go of a superfluous note and their excellent diction enhances their singing all the more.\n\nThe medley of &quot;Rockin' Round the Christmas Tree&quot; and &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; is thrown in for some fun and it all holds its own very well--the child in all of us is sure to love this number! I wouldn't have thought of combining &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; and &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; to make another medley; but it works and that's amazing. Other secular songs include &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; which features Karl Scully in the spotlight. Karl's solo performance of &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; moves me with its beauty; and I doubt I'll ever tire of listening to him sing this.\n\n&quot;Silent Night&quot; gets a very sensitive treatment and I really like their rendition of &quot;O Holy Night.&quot; Another religious song is &quot;Mary Did You Know;&quot; Finbar Wright does this with panache and I won't forget it anytime soon!\n\nOverall, The Irish Tenors raised the bar for a fine Christmas album--and then they raised it some more! Their work just on this album alone more than proves they have incredible skill and talent; and if we're lucky they'll release more albums and perform together for many years to come.[/quote]\n \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  -  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............:  \nAlbum................:  \nGenre................: Classical, Christmas, Ireland, Vocal Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2009\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: FhG\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: CBR 160, (avg. bitrate: 160kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: , ID3 v2.2\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............:  on 11/7/2013\nPosted by............:  on 9/28/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.   -                                                     [01:41]\n   2.   -                                                     [04:17]\n   3.   -                                                     [05:08]\n   4.   -                                                     [03:54]\n   5.   -                                                     [03:07]\n   6.   -                                                     [02:43]\n   7.   -                                                     [04:02]\n   8.   -                                                     [02:51]\n   9.   -                                                     [03:24]\n  10.   -                                                     [02:46]\n  11.   -                                                     [02:49]\n  12.   -                                                     [03:24]\n  13.
