Originally a single B-side, it peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 29, 1958 and #18 on the UK Singles Chart. The handclapping is performed by Sharon Sheeley, and the deep vocals at the end of each verse are done by Cochran. The drummer on that recording date was Earl Palmer.\n\nThe song was used in the 1980 movie Caddyshack. In March 2005, Q magazine placed it at #77 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.\n\nThe song is ranked #73 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nPart of its lyrics address the controversy surrounding the voting age, which at the time was 21. Such protests would lead to the 26th Amendment, lowering the age to 18.\n\nBlue Cheer's version\nBlue Cheer recorded it for their 1968 album Vincebus Eruptum. Their version, which omits all of the response lyrics heard in Cochran's version in favor of instrumental responses by each member of the band, was featured as one of the first heavy metal recordings in the 2005 documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey.\n\nDuring the '80s MTV played a black &amp; white video for the song, taken from a TV program, in their Closet Classics segment. The song was also featured in the 1986 movie Troll and the 1991 movie Night on Earth and the 1996 movie I Shot Andy Warhol.\n\nBlue Cheer - Summertimes Blues (Beat Club 1968)\nVideo: MPEG1 Video 352x288 29.97fps 104857Kbps [Video]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 224Kbps [Audio]\nLenght :06:19\nQuality: Good B/W (Running Clock In Picture)\n\n\nBlue Cheer - Summertime Blues (American Bandstand 02-10-68 + Interview)\nVideo: MPEG1 Video 352x288 29.97fps 104857Kbps [Video]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 224Kbps [Audio]\nLenght :06:19\nQuality: Good B/W","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45fafac20ff449bc1b9d77ac1fd221af88fbe868","amp;dn":"Blue+Cheer+-+Summertimes+Blues+%28Beat+Club+%26+American+Bandstan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45fafac20ff449bc1b9d77ac1fd221af88fbe868","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,250,250,194,15,244,73,188,27,157,119,172,31,210,33,175,136,251,232,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
