They arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really representatives of America, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re more like ambassadors to AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â€and from a hostile place at that.\n\nThe 80 members of the suicide caucus represent only 18 percent of the populationÃ¢â‚¬â€and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure their share of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brain cells is much lower than that. While America is becoming less white, the districts of the Tea Partiers are actually getting more white... as if that were even possible! The average House district is 63 percent white, but the suicide caucus districts are 75 percent white. The only way these people could get whiter is if they do that thing where you bleach your butthole.\n\nNewt Gingrich says Ã¢â‚¬Å“The big problem is that President Obama refuses to behave like an American president.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Newt, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to bother with the racist code. Your particular brand of racist code was cracked years ago. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more obvious than pig Latin.\n\nChristian TV host Rick Joyner says that for America Ã¢â‚¬Å“the only hope is a military takeover, martial law.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how far Obama derangement has gone. They prefer a military dictatorship to man America elected. Twice.\n\nYesterday major portions of Obamacare kicked in, while Republicans were vainly trying to kick Obamacare out. Obamacare is doing just fineÃ¢â‚¬â€like millions of people who are already starting to use it will soon be doing. There were a few snags because the online exchanges were swamped with people seeking healthcare. So the only thing that held Obamacare back at all was its enormous popularity. While Republicans kept insisting that Americans wanted Obamacare repealed, yesterday proved that Americans just want Obamacare, period.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:096b2e9e212ac0b49af3bdca4658d678c4ab2c4b","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+02+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"096b2e9e212ac0b49af3bdca4658d678c4ab2c4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,107,46,158,33,42,192,180,154,243,189,202,70,88,214,120,196,171,44,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
