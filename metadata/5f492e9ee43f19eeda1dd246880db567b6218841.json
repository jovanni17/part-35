Under the command of LtCol MillÃƒÂ¡n Astray and Comandante Francisco Franco, the Spanish Foreign Legion developed into a formidable force, led by Astray's belief that 'to die in combat is the greatest honour.' This book examines the main campaigns in which the Legion participated, from Melilla in 1921-23 until its withdrawal from the Sahara in 1976. A wealth of contemporary photographs and colour plates detail the uniforms and insignia of the Spanish Foreign Legion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f492e9ee43f19eeda1dd246880db567b6218841","amp;dn":"The+Spanish+Foreign+Legion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f492e9ee43f19eeda1dd246880db567b6218841","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,73,46,158,228,63,25,238,218,29,210,70,136,13,181,103,182,33,136,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
