But hidden beneath the straightened hair and expertly applied makeup is a secret that her friends would never understand: Sam has Purely-Obsessional OCD and is consumed by a stream of dark thoughts and worries that she can't turn off. \r\n\r\nSecond-guessing every move, thought, and word makes daily life a struggle, and it doesn't help that her lifelong friends will turn toxic at the first sign of a wrong outfit, wrong lunch, or wrong crush. Yet Sam knows she'd be truly crazy to leave the protection of the most popular girls in school. So when Sam meets Caroline, she has to keep her new friend with a refreshing sense of humor and no style a secret, right up there with Sam's weekly visits to her psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nCaroline introduces Sam to Poet's Corner, a hidden room and a tight-knit group of misfits who have been ignored by the school at large. Sam is drawn to them immediately, especially a guitar-playing guy with a talent for verse, and starts to discover a whole new side of herself. Slowly, she begins to feel more &quot;normal&quot; than she ever has as part of the popular crowd . . . until she finds a new reason to question her sanity and all she holds dear.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9189386ba777e626b8d94d4b5442cf0578eee6e","amp;dn":"Every+Last+Word+-+Tamara+Ireland+Stone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9189386ba777e626b8d94d4b5442cf0578eee6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,24,147,134,186,119,126,98,107,141,148,212,181,68,44,240,87,142,238,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
