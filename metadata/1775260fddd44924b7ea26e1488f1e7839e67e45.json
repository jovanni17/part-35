Another J.J. Grandville scan! (This one was misnamed &quot;Grandview&quot; - it happens, I know! - so I corrected that.) This book, 'Gravures', is not at all like the previously uploaded whimsical and surreal 'Another World'. No, 'Gravures' is clearly a collection of more political satire and day-to-day observational work (and it's pretty clear what is going on and who is being skewered in most of the pieces). Still brilliantly illustrated, still far ahead of his time. This guy would have been a rock star in the modern comic book era. He published quite a few books during his life, so I'm always hoping more of them might turn up.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nGravures\n\nUnknown Publisher (I didn't look very hard), 1880 (maybe - the artwork if much older though, 40 years or so), 122 pages\n\nWritten and Illustrated by J.J. Grandville\n\nThe Another World torrent is no longer being seeded, so I'm putting those in this one, as well.\n\n'Another World'\n\nAlthough I'm sure it says, I'm not sure exactly who the publisher was. It was printed in 1847, though.\n\nThe illustrations of J.J. Granville\n\nThere is nothing else I could say here that can't be better explained by this Wiki page and it's incombent links...  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ignace_Isidore_G%C3%A9rard_Grandville&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ignace_Isidore_G%C3%A9rard_Grandville&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEncyclopedia dot com has a lengthy entry on him as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1775260fddd44924b7ea26e1488f1e7839e67e45","amp;dn":"J.J.+Grandville+-+Gravures+%281880%29+Another+World+%281847%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1775260fddd44924b7ea26e1488f1e7839e67e45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,117,38,15,221,212,73,36,183,234,38,225,72,143,30,120,57,230,126,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
