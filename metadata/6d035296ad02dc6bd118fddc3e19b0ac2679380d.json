It was broadcast in ten hour-long episodes (ed. Marley segment featured only here), one dedicated to each year, with the first episode, I Love 1970, premiering on BBC Two on 22 July 2000, and the last, I Love 1979, premiering on 23 September 2000. The series proved successful and thus was followed by two similar series, I Love The '80s and I Love The '90s, both of which aired during 2001.\n\nSweet little take on Bob. Not the least bring up their ideas about &amp; memories of the days that were in London whereabouts such as Clapham, Hackney, the East End and even upper-class Hampstead. Memories ranging from Bob's early sightings at The Speakeasy Club to the grandeur of a packed Lyceum. Not all are fully correct regarding dates and venues, so you'll have to be easy on them for that.\n\n..\n\nbonus -\nThe Old Grey Whistle Test, Lime Grove Studios, London, England\n1973/05/01\nbroadcast date - 2011/09/23 ('70s Gold - UPGRADE)\nBBCFour&gt;DVB-C Philips stand alone DVD\nvideo, MPEG2, 6100 KBPS, 352x576, 4:3, PAL\naudio, AC3, 384 KBPS, STEREO\n\n\nConcrete Jungle\n\nrunning time - 04:11\n\n\nOne Love!\n\n\n\nchico, reggaetraders.net (RT), 2011/12/18","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d035296ad02dc6bd118fddc3e19b0ac2679380d","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+-+I+Love+The+%2770s%3A+1975","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d035296ad02dc6bd118fddc3e19b0ac2679380d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,3,82,150,173,2,220,107,209,24,253,220,62,25,176,172,38,121,56,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
