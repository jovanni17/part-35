Now, the fondly remembered game, Gold Rush! has been developed anew, to todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest standards. No aspect of modern gaming has been overlooked. \n\nYou can experience the famous California Gold Rush with high-resolution graphics, speech synthesis, a superb sound track and modern user interface features. Optimized game-flow will enhance your traveling and interactions with other characters of the period.\n\nGold Rush! takes you back to the year 1849, when gold was discovered in California. It was certainly one of the most exciting times in American history. Gold Rush! includes the three routes tens of thousands took to the gold regions. Become Jerrod Wilson and experience each trek as you travel from New York to California.\n\nWhichever route you decide to take, you will see many historical sights. Try going overland across the Great Plains and huge mountain ranges, crossing the Isthmus of Panama, or rounding Cape Horn on the tip of South America. \n\nIf you survive and arrive at SutterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fort, the adventure is still only half over! Many other puzzles remain to be solved before you achieve your goals in California.\n\nFeatures:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Far more than 130 pre-rendered images and animated scenes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Three different approaches\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ High quality voices in English, texts in English and German\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New recorded music\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Subtitles in English or German (Point &amp; Click!)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Optimized quests, dead-ends and random-dies\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New intelligent Point&amp;Click control, optimized for touch!\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- Fixed start-problems on a few systems.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunlightgames.goldrushanniversary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunlightgames.goldrushanniversary&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.Copy 'com.sunlightgames.goldrushanniversary' folder to 'sdcard/Android/obb'\n2.Install APK\n3.Launch the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b225f6590291571e0b6991f6047f6bb28e1f131","amp;dn":"Gold+Rush%21+Anniversary+v1.1.2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b225f6590291571e0b6991f6047f6bb28e1f131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,34,95,101,144,41,21,113,224,182,153,31,96,71,246,187,40,225,241,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
