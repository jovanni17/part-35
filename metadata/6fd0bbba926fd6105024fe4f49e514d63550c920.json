The game features a variety of tracks spanning several different planets and includes all and more of the racers featured in the movie, including, but not limited to, Teemto Pagalies, Dud Bolt, Mars Guo, Ben Quadinaros.\n\nThis is my Dreamcast emulated version, which works very well on 32bit OS, I don't think it works on 64 bit, but I'm not sure. I have tested this on Windows 7 32 bit only.\n\nUse the icon on your desktop to begin, a screen will appear, go to &quot;System&quot; &amp; press &quot;Start&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DAmdOaael&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DAmdOaael&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy default I have set the Fullscreen mode to &quot;On&quot;, at 1024x768, you can change this in the Options section.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eaMDBAAeL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eaMDBAAeL&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI have put a picture of the default controls within the game dir, the Xpadder profiles are mapped to that configuration.\n\nI'm uploading this because I downloaded this version:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8466477/Star_Wars__Episode_I__Racer_(1999)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8466477/Star_Wars__Episode_I__Racer_(1999)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nbut it didn't work for me, so I put together an emulated version which works with NVidia cards as well.\n\nMy Screens taken with Fraps playing with nVidia GeForce GT 640 graphics card:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAMdmaAel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAMdmaAel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXpadder with profiles for Xbox360 &amp; PS3 are included.\n\nEnjoy this neat little classic, &amp; please seed at least 1:1 if you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fd0bbba926fd6105024fe4f49e514d63550c920","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Episode+I+Racer+%28Dreamcast+Emulation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fd0bbba926fd6105024fe4f49e514d63550c920","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,208,187,186,146,111,214,16,80,36,254,79,73,229,20,214,53,80,201,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
