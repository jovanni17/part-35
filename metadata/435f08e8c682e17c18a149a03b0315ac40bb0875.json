The Fantom has highly superior weapons to the normal weapons of that day, and he also has extreme cunning, as we see by his tricking the countries into suspecting each other for war-mongering. A supposed loyalist to her Majesty's Empire is sent to fetch Allan Quatermain in an effort to track down the group who is trying to start the war. In a private and secret meeting, Quatermain meets who he is to be teaming up with on this mission. He is accompanied by Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Rodney Skinner, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer, and Dr. Henry Jekyll (also Mr. Edward Hyde). Soon into their adventure they discover that the Fantom is behind these attacks, but there is more to this war than battle and cunning.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311429/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311429/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nplease seed. full disc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:435f08e8c682e17c18a149a03b0315ac40bb0875","amp;dn":"the+league+of+extraordinary+gentlemenLXG_43%28ntsc%29.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"435f08e8c682e17c18a149a03b0315ac40bb0875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,95,8,232,198,130,225,124,24,161,73,160,59,3,21,172,64,187,8,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
