It has been recorded by many people, but the first released version was recorded by The Shadows in June 1960 and released the following month. The song topped the UK Singles Chart for five weeks. In March 2005, Q magazine placed &quot;Apache&quot; at No.96 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.\n         &quot;I Feel Free&quot; is a song recorded by Cream. The song's lyrics were written by Pete Brown, its music by Jack Bruce. It was the first track on the US issue of their debut album, &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; (1966), and the band's second hit single (the first being &quot;Wrapping Paper&quot;). &quot;I Feel Free&quot; showcases the band's musical diversity, effectively combining blues rock with psychedelic pop.\n         &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is a song originally written and performed by Jake Holmes.He recorded &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; for his debut solo album &quot;The Above Ground Sound&quot;, released in June 1967. \nLater it was covered by the Yardbirds, and later reworked by Led Zeppelin.When the Yardbirds disbanded in 1968, Page planned to record the song yet again, this time with Led Zeppelin. According to Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, the first time he heard the song was at the band's very first rehearsal session at Gerrard Street in London in 1968: &quot;Jimmy played us the riffs at the first rehearsal and said, 'This is a number I want us to do'.&quot; Led Zeppelin recorded their version in October 1968 at Olympic Studios, London, and the song was included on their 1969 debut album Led Zeppelin. The Led Zeppelin version was not credited to Holmes. Page used the title, penned a new set of lyrics, and changed enough of the melody to escape a plagiarism lawsuit from Holmes Ã¢â‚¬â€ the song's arrangement, however, remained markedly similar to the version performed by The Yardbirds the previous year. While Holmes took no action at the time, he did later contact Page in regards to the matter. Page had not replied as of 2001. In June 2010 Holmes filed a lawsuit in United States District Court, alleging copyright infringement and naming Page as a co-defendant. The 2012 live album Celebration Day attributes the song to &quot;Page; inspired by Jake Holmes&quot;, although the writer's credit with ASCAP remains unchanged\n         &quot;My Generation&quot; was released as a single on 5 November 1965, reaching No. 2 in the UK, the Who's highest charting single in their home country and No. 74 in America. The song was named the 11th greatest song by Rolling Stone on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and 13th on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Songs of Rock &amp; Roll.It's also part of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and is inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant&quot; value. In 2009 it was named the 37th Greatest Hard Rock Song by VH1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bacf8c75911857898e05ddc359f8f7064fafbf5","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+475","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bacf8c75911857898e05ddc359f8f7064fafbf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,172,248,199,89,17,133,120,152,224,93,220,53,159,143,112,100,250,251,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
