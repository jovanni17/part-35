The file info.xml gives the number\nof tile rows and columns and the number of empty pixels at the right and\nbottom edges (these should be discarded/ignored during viewing or machine\nprocessing).\n\nThis torrent is permanently seeded by my seedbox and also web-seeded. It is the highest-resolution image I've ever dealt with, at 14.0 gigapixels, or 1400 times more pixels than a digital camera photo - but this resolution is more than justified by the intricate detail of this wall-size artwork.\n\nViewing or processing an image represented in this format requires special\nsoftware. Even if the tiles were assembled into a single TIFF image, merely\nloading it in a standard image editor like Photoshop would require far more\nRAM than most PCs have. Moreover, the JPEG file format does not support\nimages of such high resolution due to limitations on width and height.\n\nA complete tile pyramid can be constructed by combining and downscaling each\nset of four adjacent tiles to form the next pyramid level down, then\nrepeating this until a single tile is reached. Such tile pyramids are\nroutinely used by viewing software for very large images, which load the\ntiles in view on-demand, and use the different levels to support zoom\nfunctionality. It is also possible to create software which crops\nout a portion of the image (a detail) and saves it as a JPEG at maximum\nresolution. If you create software like this, please consider publishing\nit under an open source license so that others can benefit from it. There\nmay also be other unanticipated uses for this data.\n\nThis data is in the public domain in the United States under the case law of\nBridgeman Art Library v.
