Simple Explanation (3:43)\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a testament to Wilco's greatness that most of the band members are active members of other side projects, yet the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s output has not suffered. The list of side projects is long: Frontman Jeff Tweedy and drummer Glenn Kotche are members of Loose Fur; Tweedy tours as a solo act; Kotche is a member of On Fillmore (as well as other projects); guitarist Nils Cline has a long history with numerous bands that have never officially disbanded; and bassist John Stirratt and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone have their own group, the Autumn Defense. Indeed, while many bands view such side projects as the musical equivalent of adultery, Wilco seems to thrive when its member are free to explore their musical whimsies.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c332b708e7d738258ebf22bce070034a89fd967d","amp;dn":"The+Autumn+Defense+-+The+Autumn+Defense+%5B2006%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c332b708e7d738258ebf22bce070034a89fd967d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,50,183,8,231,215,56,37,142,191,34,188,224,112,3,74,137,253,150,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
