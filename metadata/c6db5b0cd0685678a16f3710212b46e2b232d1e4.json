These lists may contain some minor corrections and has been renumbered for accessibility reasons and the use in a car. You dont know and you do not want it all? For Songs of the heart choose: _I148 2 Love Is Hard, for Lounge; _I137 1 Breeze. for Romantic Pop; _I140 2 Building Bridges. For Electro Rock; _I152 3 Space. For Solid Rock; _I131 4 Your Wish or _I133 4 Rootless. And for Symphonic Rock Lovers, my personal favorite: _I135 3 Deprived... Or pick any other, depending on the type of list you like..... Enjoy,\n\nTypes of Playlists (Number directly behind the serial number):\n\n 1 = Soft Pop and Folk, top sound quality\n 2 = A mix of Rock and Pop, a bit more extreme and little less sound quality\n 3 = Electronic, varying from chill to Rock\n 4 = Solid Rock\n 5 = Garage Rock and Dance\n\nOh Yes, I almost forgot to thank all other idiots making their Indie heard by making Playlists. Please take care in passing it through. Quality, cuts, labels, volume and stuff. I think the Artists would appreciate it (and the listeners too).\n\n\n~@~ Indie Playlists July-September 2013\n\nI131 4 Your Wish\nI132 4 Naked\nI133 4 Rootless\nI134 5 Friends\nI135 3 Deprived\nI136 2 Fragments\nI137 1 Breeze\nI138 1 Just Enough\nI139 1 Delicate\nI140 2 Building Bridges\nI141 2 Follow Follow\nI142 1 Friend Like You\nI143 2 Confusion\nI144 2 Get Lucky\nI145 1 Music Box\nI146 2 Bright Smile\nI147 2 Fantasy\nI148 2 Love Is Hard\nI149 2 Hey Doreen\nI150 2 Jigsaw\nI151 3 Dust Clears\nI152 3 Space\nI153 3 If You Leave\nI154 3 Into The Sun\nI155 3 The Wire\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6db5b0cd0685678a16f3710212b46e2b232d1e4","amp;dn":"Dutch+Treat+Update+I131-155+%28Indie+Playlists+July-September+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6db5b0cd0685678a16f3710212b46e2b232d1e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,219,91,12,208,104,86,120,161,111,55,16,33,43,70,226,178,50,209,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
