Turn It Up! Electric Blues - The Definitive Collection, Pt. 2: 1954-1967 [2012]\n\nOriginal Release / Bear Family / BCD 16922 CP / CD\n\n(3 CD-digipac with 172-page booklet) Blues historian and musicologist Bill Dahl from Chicago has produced the most comprehensive history of electric blues ever! With nearly 300 tracks, BEAR FAMILY RECORDS is telling the story from the beginning into the new millennium. Every significant artist... every significant recording from the 1930s to the present day, including T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, George Thorogood, and Freddie, B.B. and Albert King, Jeff Beck, Fleetwood Mac, Charlie Musselwhite, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, and literally hundreds more! Cross-licensed from every record company to be truly comprehensive!\n\nIn the 1930s, the invention of Gibson's ES-150 - the first electric guitar - changed popular music forever. The first generation of blues pioneers played acoustic instruments, but with the invention of amplification, guitar and harmonica players could be heard over the piano, drums and horns. Music was revolutionized!\n\nThis is one of four 3-CD sets in elegant deluxe digipacs. All four sets combined add up to 12 generously full CDs plus more than 650 pages in four lavishly illustrated booklets, in which Bill Dahl writes authoritatively about the history of electric blues, and how it influenced rock music during the 1960s and beyond. Here's the complete story from jazz-inspired jump numbers in the late 1930s to hard-driving blues/rock from the States and Great Britain in the 1960s, '70s, and beyond. The journey closes with today's contemporary blues. This is it! Truly definitive! Done as only BEAR FAMILY can do it!\n\nallmusic.com\nThe second volume of Bear Family's four-part electric blues series Plug It In! Turn It Up! features the years 1954-1967 but that's slightly misleading, as much of the latter years are bunched up on the third disc, which rounds up 29 significant instrumentals. The rest of the collection concentrates on continuing the story the first volume began, as West Coast, Delta, and Chicago blues all began to swing harder and play louder, working their way onto rock &amp; roll jukeboxes as they did so. Some of these singles do play like rock &amp; roll -- that's particularly true of Bo Diddley's heavy-footed rumble and Hank Ballard's easy shuffle on &quot;Look at Little Sister&quot; -- but this is primarily devoted to electrified blues that jolts and jumps like a bare wire. There are plenty of big names and classics here, songs that would later be standards in any number of house bands across the country: &quot;Kansas City,&quot; &quot;I'm Ready,&quot; &quot;My Babe,&quot; &quot;I'm a Man,&quot; &quot;I Wish You Wouldn't,&quot; &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby,&quot; &quot;Got My Mojo Working,&quot; &quot;I'm a King Bee,&quot; &quot;Texas Flood,&quot; &quot;Kansas City,&quot; &quot;Baby What You Want Me to Do,&quot; &quot;The Sky Is Crying,&quot; &quot;Wham!,&quot; &quot;Frosty.&quot; It's a crash course in history that plays like a party, even on that third disc of high-octane instrumentals.\n\nTracks:\n\nDisc 1\n\n01 - King, B.
