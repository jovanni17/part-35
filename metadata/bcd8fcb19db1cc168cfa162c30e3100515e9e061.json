You will have to find those files somewhere else, though. If you want your console to read the copies that you make with Xbox Backup Creator, it will have to be modified to read backup copies. That's not legal so be careful, ok:)\n\nNote: I am not responsible if you mess up your gaming console due to error on your part for flashing incorrect firmware...I only provide the tools for you . \n\n~grimreaper420~\n\n\nScanned with Norton360 3.0\n\nTorrent created and upped Jan 28, 2010\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIf anyone is having problems downloading this torrent,\nplease add these trackers to your BT client, tested on 02.02.10 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://tracker.bittorrent.am/announce\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.kg:2710/announce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcd8fcb19db1cc168cfa162c30e3100515e9e061","amp;dn":"XBOX-XBOX360+Backup+Creator+v2.9.0.306+%5BGR420%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcd8fcb19db1cc168cfa162c30e3100515e9e061","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,216,252,177,157,177,204,22,140,250,22,44,48,227,16,5,21,233,224,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
