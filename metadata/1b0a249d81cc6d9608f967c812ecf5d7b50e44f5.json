As something of a miles obsessive there's much to recommend here in a 2 hours plus wet dream for die hard fans. Peppered with incendiary footage, 'Bitches Brew', miles in bad strides, wicked and loud silk shirts, orange sunglasses, growling and glowering, trumpet through wah wah pedals and such other malarkey, theres also plenty nuff fascinating interviews with sidemen such as Herbie hancock, Keith Jarrett, Dave Liebman, Chick Corea and tributes from Carlos Santana, Joni Mitchell et al. This period reflected Miles growing interest in the works of Stockhausen, Hendrix and Sly stone, a mighty triumvirate and for our money his most inspirational and underrated material in the whole Davis canon. Culminating in the full 38 minute one track performance of 'Call It Anything' at the 1970 Isle of Wight, its still indisputably the coolest shit, the sound of improvisation mutating through fusion, rock, drugs, composition and cosmic inspiration.\n\nFollowing the release of his controversial &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; album, Miles Davis appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 29, 1970. Footage from the performance is included in this documentary that examines how Davis' groundbreaking fusion of traditional jazz and improvisational rock shook the music world to its very core. Includes insights from Joni Mitchell, Chick Corea, Carlos Santana, and others\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : F:\\DVD\\Miles Davis Miles Electric A Different Kind of Blue(avi)\\Miles Electric.avi\nFormat: Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1 000 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 608 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (MPEG)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nBit rate                         : 1 278 Kbps\nWidth                            : 608 pixels\nHeight                           : 432 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.407\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.195\nStream size                      : 795 MiB (79%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio Version 1 Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 199 MiB (20%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b0a249d81cc6d9608f967c812ecf5d7b50e44f5","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+Miles+Electric+A+Different+Kind+of+Blue%28avi%29%28music+d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b0a249d81cc6d9608f967c812ecf5d7b50e44f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,10,36,157,129,204,109,150,8,249,103,200,18,236,245,215,181,14,68,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
