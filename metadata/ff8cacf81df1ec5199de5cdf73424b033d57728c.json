I was in the right place at the right time. I just work harder than the others. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deserve this. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a matter of time before I am found out. Someone must have made a terrible mistake. \n \nIf you are a working woman, chances are this interÃ‚Â­nal monologue sounds all too familiar. And youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not alone. From the high-achieving Ph.D. candidate convinced sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only been admitted to the program because of a clerical error to the senior executive who worries others will find out sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in way over her head, a shocking number of accomplished women in all caÃ‚Â­reer paths and at every level feel as though they are faking itÃ¢â‚¬â€impostors in their own lives and careers. \n \nWhile the impostor syndrome is not unique to women, women are more apt to agonize over tiny mistakes, see even constructive criticism as eviÃ‚Â­dence of their shortcomings, and chalk up their accomplishments to luck rather than skill. They often unconsciously overcompensate with crippling perfecÃ‚Â­tionism, overpreparation, maintaining a lower proÃ‚Â­file, withholding their talents and opinions, or never finishing important projects. When they do succeed, they think, Phew, I fooled Ã¢â‚¬â„¢em again. \n \nAn internationally known speaker, Valerie Young has devoted her career to understanding womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most deeply held beliefs about themselves and their success. In her decades of in-the-trenches research, she has uncovered the often surprising reasons why so many accomplished women experience this crushing self-doubt. \n \nIn The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women, Young gives these women the solution they have been seekÃ‚Â­ing. Combining insightful analysis with effective adÃ‚Â­vice and anecdotes, she explains what the impostor syndrome is, why fraud fears are more common in women, and how you can recognize the way it maniÃ‚Â­fests in your life. With her empowering, step-by-step plan, you will learn to take ownership of your success, overcome self-doubt, and banish the thought patterns that undermine your ability to feelÃ¢â‚¬â€and actÃ¢â‚¬â€as bright and capable as others already know you are.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff8cacf81df1ec5199de5cdf73424b033d57728c","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Thoughts+of+Successful+Women+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff8cacf81df1ec5199de5cdf73424b033d57728c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,140,172,248,29,241,236,81,153,222,92,223,115,66,75,3,61,87,114,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
