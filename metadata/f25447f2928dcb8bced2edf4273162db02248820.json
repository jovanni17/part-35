An orchestrated version of &quot;Train Song&quot; was attempted during the Nicola sessions but, while fondly remembered by arranger David Palmer, did not make the finished product. Neither did two further outtakes &quot;In This Game&quot; and &quot;Dissatisfied Blues&quot; (both of which he performed live during the city hall tour of early 1967) although they later appeared on Box Of Love - The Bert Jansch Sampler Vol. 2 (1972), issued on Transatlantic shortly after Bert had left the label. They have also been resurrected on the new reissue of Nicola.[1]\n[edit]Track listing\n\n&quot;Go Your Way My Love&quot; (Jansch, Anne Briggs)\n&quot;Woe Is Love My Dear&quot; (Jansch)\n&quot;Nicola&quot; (Jansch)\n&quot;Come Back Baby&quot; (Walter Davis)\n&quot;A Little Sweet Sunshine&quot; (Jansch)\n&quot;Love Is Teasing&quot; (traditional)\n&quot;Rabbit Run&quot; (Jansch)\n&quot;Life Depends On Love&quot; (Jansch)\n&quot;Weeping Willow Blues&quot; (traditional)\n&quot;Box Of Love&quot; (Jansch)\n&quot;Wish My Baby Was Here&quot; (Jansch)\n&quot;If The World Isn't There&quot; (Jansch)\n&quot;In This Game&quot; (Jansch) [re-release only]\n&quot;Dissatisfied Blues&quot; (Jansch) [re-release only]\n\nReleased\tJuly 1967\nRecorded\tc.
