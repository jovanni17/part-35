In this tale of carnage from the Eisner Award-nominated team of artist Ashley Wood (Popbot) and writer Chris Ryall (The Great and Secret Show). A post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies has only one chance at recovery - a team of robots that must protect and clone a lone surviving human baby. They just need to do this amidst the endless hordes of zombies who have been driven rabid by their frustration at inedible bots and their lust to eat the one living brain left on the planet.\n\nChris Ryall (w); Ashley Wood (a &amp;c) When last we visited the Zombies vs. Robots world, nuclear war had decimated the population of the entire globe, including zombies and robots alike. So who is left to fight? And how is an island of Amazon warrior-women involved this time around? Ryall and Wood answer some questions, leave you with more, and generally make sense out of nonsense for your amusement in this first issue of an all-new, three-part tale. \n\nThe Infestation is over, but the zombies remain!
