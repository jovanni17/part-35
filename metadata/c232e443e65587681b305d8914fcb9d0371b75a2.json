Here's The Beatles&quot; (2011).\nLABEL : Fake Decca (45-F, 11486).\n\nContrast clause:\nThis torrent is sourced from the 2011 release titled &quot;Nevermind the Tremeleloes. . . Here's The Beatles&quot;, whereas the torrent found at http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=194207 is sourced from the Dr. Ebbetts release from several years prior.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n01 02:22 Money (That's What I Want) (Janie Bradford/Berry Gordy).\n02 The Sheik of Araby (Harry B. Smith/Ted Snyder/Francis Wheeler). ***OMITTED***\n03 02:19 Memphis Tennessee (Chuck Berry).\n04 Three Cool Cats (Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller). ***OMITTED***\n05 02:02 Sure to Fall (In Love with You) (Bill Cantrell/Quinton Claunch/Carl Perkins).\n06 01:54 September in the Rain (Al Dubin/Harry Warren).\n07 02:25 Take Good Care of My Baby (Gerry Goffin/Carole King).\n08 02:58 Till there was You (Meredith Willson).\n09 02:02 Crying, Waiting, Hoping (Buddy Holly).\n10 02:34 To Know Her is to Love Her (Phil Spector).\n11 02:39 Besame Mucho (Consuelo VelÃƒÂ¡zquez).\n12 Searchin' (Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller). ***OMITTED***\n13 Like Dreamers do (John Lennon/Paul McCartney). ***OMITTED***\n14 Hello Little Girl (John Lennon/Paul McCartney). ***OMITTED***\n15 01:51 Love of the Loved (John Lennon/Paul McCartney).\n16 Commentary by Brian Epstein. ***OMITTED***\n\n23:06 Total running time (all times are estimated).\n\nTracks 02, 04, 12, 13, 14, and 16 have been omitted due to official release (see &quot;Anthology 1&quot; disc 1).\n\nThis disc was ripped via EAC into a single WAV file (see the accompanying log file), then converted to FLAC (which is how I received it). I then converted the FLAC to WAV via Trader's Little Helper, imported the WAV into Audacity, split the songs into individual tracks, exported each as a separate WAV file, and converted those into FLAC via Trader's Little Helper (in which form I now share them). I also created the md5 checksum via Trader's Little Helper.\n\nComments (from BootlegZone):\n\nThis is the new 'HBNL' source. True intro to &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Hello Little Girl&quot;, possible longer outros to some songs (haven't fully compared). Basically this was one of the 1st dubs from the master edit reel which was possibly used for the bootlegs that came out in the 70s. Though just google this title and you might find out more about this material from other forums. This is as good as it gets though people might argue. Can this source be remastered? Should it?\n\nBeatle people who have heard this already say:\n&quot;Get this NOW! It cannot possibly be improved upon. As far as Decca Tapes go, all other issues are now officially obsolete.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sounds really good!&quot;\n\n&quot;Congratulations on this! I did some very careful listening to &quot;Like Dreamers Do&quot; from about a half dozen sources and this one not only seems the best, it is amazingly close to the Anthology version.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sounds incredible.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you for this. Finally got a chance to do some in-depth analysis on this, and it is indeed better than what I thought was previously the best source.. Plus, yours is at the correct speed!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c232e443e65587681b305d8914fcb9d0371b75a2","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+1962-01-01+-+Decca+Studios%2C+London","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c232e443e65587681b305d8914fcb9d0371b75a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,50,228,67,230,85,135,104,27,48,93,137,20,252,185,208,55,27,117,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
