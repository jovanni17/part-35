In Dr. Bergmaâ€™s humorous and deeply He shows that Johnâ€™s use of the word â€œsignsâ€ for Jesusâ€™ miracles is no accident. In fact, these signs actually point to the seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church. As Dr. Bergsma makes his case, it becomes more and more clear that the similarities between sign and sacrament are no coincidence, and that the Gospel of John is a deeply Catholic book.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please seed and support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
