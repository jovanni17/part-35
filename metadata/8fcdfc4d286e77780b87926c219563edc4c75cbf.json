Of huge practical help to anyone diagnosed with cancer and those who care for them, this book is a one-stop guide to making sense and use of the orthodox treatments, complementary therapies, and psychological, spiritual and holistic options available. Subjects ranging from the most current major advances in treatments and diagnosis to the small but effective ways of relieving the side-effects are explained clearly and concisely, often with humour and always with warmth. Written by a bright, articulate woman, who was determined to have an informed say in what happened to her, Anni's Cancer Companion marks a new generation of books about cancer. It is that rare thing: a reference book that is human.\n\n\n# Paperback: 315 pages\n# Publisher: Singing Dragon; 1 edition (June 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1848190670\n# ISBN-13: 978-1848190672","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fcdfc4d286e77780b87926c219563edc4c75cbf","amp;dn":"Anni%5C%27s+Cancer+Companion+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fcdfc4d286e77780b87926c219563edc4c75cbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,205,252,77,40,110,119,120,11,135,146,108,33,149,99,237,196,199,92,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
