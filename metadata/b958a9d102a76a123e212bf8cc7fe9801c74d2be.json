Corey introduces you to the major theories (psychoanalytic, Adlerian, existential, person-centered, Gestalt, reality, behavior, cognitive-behavior, family systems, feminist, and postmodern approaches) and demonstrates how each theory can be applied to a single case (&quot;Stan&quot;). With his trademark style, he shows you how to apply those theories in practice, and helps you learn to integrate the theories into an individualized counseling style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b958a9d102a76a123e212bf8cc7fe9801c74d2be","amp;dn":"Theory+and+Practice+of+Counseling+and+Psychotherapy%2C+9E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b958a9d102a76a123e212bf8cc7fe9801c74d2be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,88,169,209,2,167,106,18,62,33,43,248,204,127,233,128,28,116,210,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
