And that's a fact! Rob Halford, better known as ex-singer for Judas Priest, joined Sabbath for two gigs to support Ozzy on his last shows for the &quot;No More Tours&quot;-Tour because Dio refused to do so! On this boot you can hear recordings from the second concert plus recordings of the four tracks which Black Sabbath Mark I played finally at the show together and which later on lead to the plans for a great re-union with Osbourne/Butler/Iommi/Ward! Recordings are made in the crowd, so sound quality is less good then on radio shows but still ok. Released in 1993, supposed to be released by an Italian label.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:924527319eac730e153cbb3a2a7d19340d907e91","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+with+Rob+Halford+-+1992+-+Ozzy+Meets+The+Priest+19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"924527319eac730e153cbb3a2a7d19340d907e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,69,39,49,158,172,115,14,21,60,187,58,42,125,25,52,13,144,126,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
