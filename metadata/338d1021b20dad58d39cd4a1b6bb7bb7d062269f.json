The Tudor knight was the first line of defence employed by monarchs from Henry VIII to Elizabeth I, the last of a long tradition of knighthood dating back to the 11th century. Knighthood during the Tudor era saw reforms in recruitment, appearance, and most radically in training and equipment. This book details those changes, profiling the knight's appearance and dress, life on campaign, and experience of battle in France, Scotland and Ireland. It also explores the concept of chivalry, as sensationally enacted by Henry VIII and Francis I of France at the celebrated Field of Cloth of Gold near Calais, in 1520.\n\n\n# Paperback: 64 pages\n# Publisher: Osprey Publishing (May 30, 2006)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1841769703\n# ISBN-13: 978-1841769707","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:338d1021b20dad58d39cd4a1b6bb7bb7d062269f","amp;dn":"Tudor+Knight+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"338d1021b20dad58d39cd4a1b6bb7bb7d062269f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,141,16,33,178,13,173,88,211,156,212,161,182,187,123,183,208,98,38,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
