The sinewy leader has a unique--and creepy--jail for master villains and she has her sights set on Riddick. And Jack as they cross paths with a ship of body hunters and are brought on board. The captain of the ship, Chillingsworth has an interesting hobby - she captures wanted criminals and makes living statues of them.\n\n\nFIXED TORRENT\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0742df194ec3b0022aa1fdc1acfe9a45a60fafed","amp;dn":"The+Chronicles+of+Riddick%3A+Dark+Fury+%282004%29+Animation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0742df194ec3b0022aa1fdc1acfe9a45a60fafed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,66,223,25,78,195,176,2,42,161,253,193,172,254,154,69,166,15,175,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
