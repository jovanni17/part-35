It provides an account of the latest research results in European chemistry based on a selection of leading young scientists participating in the 2008 European Young Chemists Award competition. The contributions range from self-organization to new catalytic synthetic methodologies to organocatalysis. In addition, the authors provide a current overview of their field of research and a preview of future directions.\nFor organic, catalytic, natural products and biochemists.\n\n\n\nHardcover: 1272 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-VCH; 1 edition (August 17, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3527328750\nISBN-13: 978-3527328758","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00222d7f3ab1bb7230526eb97733c77e9aef2d9b","amp;dn":"Ideas+in+Chemistry+and+Molecular+Sciences+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00222d7f3ab1bb7230526eb97733c77e9aef2d9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,34,45,127,58,177,187,114,48,82,110,185,119,51,199,126,154,239,45,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
