It's not a fan interpretation or anything else short of the real songs from the real composer.\n\n    * This was personally crafted by Eric Brosius from the original audio, meaning that unlike the 22khz audio files from the shipping game this release is CD quality.\n\n    * The audio quality is much higher than what's out there; this was ripped from the original CD.\n\nBasically, this is not only the best quality version of the soundtrack, it's the version of the soundtrack that Eric Brosius himself created. It's not a fan compilation; this is the real deal.\n\n\n\n\n:::::INFO:::::\n\nAuthor:        Eric Brosius\nYear:          1999\nCodec:         MP3 CBR/ lame3.96r\nBitrate:       320kbps\nRate:          44100 Hz\nRuntime:       50 minutes 02 seconds\nTotal size:    114 MB\nTracks:\n01.
