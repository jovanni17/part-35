In Chapter One Knights of the Old Republic Volume Five, a terrible vision reaching far into the future alerts the secret Jedi Covenant to the importance of Taris. They activate operative Celeste Morne. She encounters a monstrous threat, an ancient Sith artifact, an army of Mandalorians, and Zayne Carrick, the Padawan accused of killing his fellow students!\n\nThen, over 4,000 years into the future, Chapter Two of &quot;Vector&quot; -- Volume Three of Dark Times -- crosses into the period immediately following the events in Revenge of the Sith. The unfortunate misfit crew of the Uhumele is thrown into the path of Darth Vader and the now, ancient Jedi Master, Celeste! Both Sith and smugglers will not leave this meeting without grave consequences...\n\nIn Chapter Three (Rebellion Volume 4) Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia have to deal with Vector as it crosses their paths and changes the galaxy! On the dark surface of a desolate moon, Luke meets his first Jedi since Obi-Wan Kenobi, only to realize too late that Celeste Morne is far different than his fallen friend -- twisted by a Sith Talisman and enraged by Darth Vader!\n\nThen, over 135 years later, in the final chapter (Legacy Volume 6), Cade Skywalker's plan to assassinate Emperor Darth Krayt is aided by a &quot;secret weapon&quot; in the form of Celeste Morne -- the Jedi Knight of the Old Republic who is in possession of, and possibly possessed by, the powerful Muur Talisman. Cade and Celeste will change the galaxy -- for better, or for worse!\n\nThe epic Star Wars: Vector storyline spread over four thousand years of history and crossed over four comic-book series -- Rebellion, Knights of the Old Republic, Dark Times, and Legacy!\n\nFor anyone who never knew where to start with Star Wars comics, &quot;Vector&quot; is the perfect introduction to the entire Star Wars line!
