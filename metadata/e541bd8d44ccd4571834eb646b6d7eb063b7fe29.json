There was nobody quite like LightninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Hopkins. John Lee Hooker may have made more records but even he couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t match the consistently high level of HopkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ creativity. Lightnin' and his vast repertoire represented the epitome of Texas country blues. No question. He came from a musical family and his unique guitar style was fashioned from the traditions he learned in the presence of Blind Lemon Jefferson and Texas Alexander, a distant cousin. His guitar both underscored and complemented the songs he drew from his own life and the lives of those around him.\n\n\nTracklist\n1 Home in the Woods\n2 Tap Dance Boogie\n3 Worried Blues\n4 One Kind of Favor\n5 Untrue Blues\n6 Fast Life Woman\n7 My Heart to Weep\n8 I'll Never Forget the Day\n9 Broken Hearted Blues\n10 Lightnin's Gone Again\n11 European Blues\n12 Lightnin's Blues \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e541bd8d44ccd4571834eb646b6d7eb063b7fe29","amp;dn":"Lightnin%5C%27+Hopkins++Dirty+Blues+%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e541bd8d44ccd4571834eb646b6d7eb063b7fe29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,65,189,141,68,204,212,87,24,52,235,100,107,109,126,176,99,183,254,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
