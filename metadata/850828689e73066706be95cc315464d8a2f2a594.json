This book includes classic favorites, like picket fences and panel fences, but also includes interesting regional variations, like Virginia split rail fences and dry-fit stone garden walls. Also included here are the latest materials, such as new variations on PVC vinyl and polymer-coated, wrought-iron look-alikes. And special attention is given to decorative boundary walls for patios-the latest trend in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cutting-edge landscape architecture. Add in major hardscape retaining wall terraces, and even an invisible electronic dog-fence project, and you have the most complete and modern book on fences and garden walls available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:850828689e73066706be95cc315464d8a2f2a594","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Guide+to+Garden+Walls+%26amp%3B+Fences","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"850828689e73066706be95cc315464d8a2f2a594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,8,40,104,158,115,6,103,6,190,149,204,49,84,100,216,162,242,165,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
