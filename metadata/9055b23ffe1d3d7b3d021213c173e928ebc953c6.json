Next, we'll spend a little time learning about the process of making connections in a shading network with the Hypershade. From there, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how we can utilize both bump maps and displacement maps to create details that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually exist in our scenes. \n\nAs youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll soon discover, rendering reflections and refractions can be a challenge. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll focus on simplifying those processes and fixing some of the common errors youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll encounter when rendering these. To wrap things up, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to render a volumetric effect like fog and make it look really good. \n\nAfter completing this course, you will have a solid foundation of knowledge to build on as you begin building your own shading networks in Maya.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9055b23ffe1d3d7b3d021213c173e928ebc953c6","amp;dn":"Utilizing+Shading+Networks+in+Maya+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9055b23ffe1d3d7b3d021213c173e928ebc953c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,85,178,63,254,29,61,123,61,2,18,19,193,115,233,40,235,201,83,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
