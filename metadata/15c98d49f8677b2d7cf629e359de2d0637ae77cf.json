Raskolnikov, a nihilistic young man in the midst of a spiritual crisis, makes the fateful decision to murder a cruel pawnbroker, justifying his actions by relying on science and reason, and creating his own morality system. Dehumanized yet sympathetic, exhausted yet hopeful, Raskolnikov represents the best and worst elements of modern intellectualism. The aftermath of his crime and Petrovich\\'s murder investigation result in an utterly compelling, truly unforgettable cat-and-mouse game. This stunning dramatization of Dostoevsky\\'s magnum opus brings the slums of St. Petersburg and the demons of Raskolnikov\\'s tortured mind vividly to life.\nTranslation by Constance Garnett, originally published in 1917.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15c98d49f8677b2d7cf629e359de2d0637ae77cf","amp;dn":"Dostoyevsky+-+Crime+and+Punishment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15c98d49f8677b2d7cf629e359de2d0637ae77cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,201,141,73,248,103,123,45,124,246,41,227,89,222,45,6,55,174,119,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
