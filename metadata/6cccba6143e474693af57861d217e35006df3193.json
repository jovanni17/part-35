Unlike its Second World War counterpart the Spitfire which was an entirely new concept based on specialised experience, the Hawker Hurricane was the logical outcome of a long line of fighting aircraft. The Spitfire was the studied application of experience; the Hurricane was a stroke of genius!\n\nThe HurricaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s maiden flight was made from Hawker's establishment within the confines of the historic Brooklands motor racing circuit at Weybridge in Surrey on November 6, 1935. A mere five years later, the Hurricane would be instrumental in enabling the Royal Air Force to win the Battle of Britain during the summer of 1940 and easily accounting for the majority of the RAFÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s air victories. In all, by the end of 1944, over 14,000 Hurricanes had been built including around 1200 converted to Sea Hurricanes. The aircraft also served in every major theatre of the Second World War.\n\nAs featured in this package, the first Hurricane Mk II flew on June 11, 1940 and utilised a Merlin XX engine with a two stage supercharger for improved performance at altitude. Later versions had reinforced fuselages in order to accommodate a new wing which had universal attachment points for drop tanks, bombs or other under wing stores. The Mk IIB arrived in late 1940 with four additional Browning .303 machine guns, bringing total armament to twelve guns. The Mk IIC which was introduced in 1941 replaced all of the machine guns with four 20mm Hispano cannons. The advent of the MK IV saw the last major change to the Hurricane which was to rationalise the wing, configuring it with a single design able to mount two bombs, two 40-mm Vickers S guns or eight 60 pounder RP-3 rockets. The new design also incorporated the newly improved Merlin 24 or 27 engines equipped with dust filters for desert operations.\n\nThis Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 &amp; FSX add-on presents four different models: the Mk IIA, the Mk IIB, the Mk IIC and the Mk IV. This package also includes a challenging mission to complete for FSX users.\n\nThe following variants of each model are included: \n\nMk IIA \n\nP2683 - 87th Squadron RAF circa 1940 \nDF+SC - (captured), circa 1940 \nV6697 - 257th Squadron RAF, circa 1940 \nMk IIB \n\nBM959, 60 of 609 IAP VVS USSR, circa 1942 \nTac.
