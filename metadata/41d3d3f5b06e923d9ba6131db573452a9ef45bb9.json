I set it 240. I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz. But lately I've increased to 64kbs and 44100hz.\n\n3. Hit the button\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\n4. create a torrent, then upload to tpb\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41d3d3f5b06e923d9ba6131db573452a9ef45bb9","amp;dn":"TTC+Power+of+Mathematical+Thinking+%28compressed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41d3d3f5b06e923d9ba6131db573452a9ef45bb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,211,211,245,176,110,146,61,155,166,19,29,181,115,69,42,158,244,91,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
