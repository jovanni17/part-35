Ant and Dan talk about CQ liking the word â€œcunt,â€ ratings over talent, Howard renewing his SiriusXM contract, we learn way too much about a newlywed couple in the audience, and Eddie Ifft joins the party to talk about politics being like wrestling, they check in with a police chase, and Eddie tells us about his own high-speed chase. The guys laugh about threats of juvie, suburban fun, Danâ€™s lack of suburban fun, Meatloaf, Scott Weiland, getting away with being an asshole, the â€œWNEW days,â€ and Eddie needing to be on the watch list. They discuss conspiracy theories, Jesse Ventura, awkward studio situations, an enema dominatrix party, Uncle Mingle, raping Edith Bunker, Dudleyâ€™s molesting, sitcom PSAâ€™s, old TV stars, fanboying, and remembering fans. Ant then talks about his new 3D goggles, Dan takes them for a spin, they discuss jacking and fleshlights, the aftermath of jacking, things chicks shouldnâ€™t see, horrible hotel shenanigans, digital delivery, spoiler alerts, the voyeur bus, the â€œpublic file,â€ the dump button, and the childishness of the FCC. The trio also chats about the media twisting words, Trump, dump sheets, Eddieâ€™s gay dog, the FCC process, jar in ass dude, shit eating, jammy wearing, rattlesnake training, neighborhood websites, a â€œhorrificâ€ news report regarding a 911 call, racially profiling, and defending yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c2e3033d557b46910b29965a1f44d58c9532f24","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-12-15+Dan+Naturman+Eddie+Ifft+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c2e3033d557b46910b29965a1f44d58c9532f24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,46,48,51,213,87,180,105,16,178,153,101,161,244,77,88,201,83,47,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
