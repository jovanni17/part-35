Set in New York City soon after the end of the Vietnam War, the film stars Robert De Niro and features Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks.\n\nIt is regularly cited by critics, film directors and audiences alike as one of the greatest films of all time. Nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it won the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival. The American Film Institute ranked Taxi Driver as the 52nd greatest American film on their AFI's 100 YearsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list. In 2012, Sight &amp; Sound named it the 31st best film ever created on its decadal critics' poll, ranked with The Godfather Part II, and the 5th greatest film ever on its directors' poll. The film was considered &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically&quot; significant by the US Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1994.\n\nTravis Bickle (Robert De Niro), an honorably discharged U.S. Marine, is a lonely and depressed man in New York City. He becomes a taxi driver to cope with chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the boroughs of New York City. He also spends time in seedy porn theaters and keeps a diary. Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign volunteer for Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), who is running for President. After watching her through her office window, interacting with fellow worker Tom (Albert Brooks), Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her and takes her out for coffee. On a later date he takes her to see a Swedish sex education film, which offends her, so she goes home alone. His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f4d7d63cc0d58cc0aba1003f1fd43f31563a408","amp;dn":"Taxi+Driver+%281976%29+DVD9+PAL+ENG+FRA+GER+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f4d7d63cc0d58cc0aba1003f1fd43f31563a408","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,77,125,99,204,13,88,204,10,186,16,3,241,253,67,243,21,99,164,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
