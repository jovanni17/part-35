This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey plays a portion of the first hit song ever to come from a motion picture; a song that sold two million records in 1928.\n\nThe family act with the most top 40 hits in the rock era (31 songs) has a song in the countdown.\n\nA listener prompted by the title of  Juice Newton's song &quot;Queen Of Hearts&quot; (at number 26) wants to know if any other song titles with the names of playing cards have been hits. Casey tells us about six such songs. Add to that list the 1986 hit, &quot;Two Of Hearts&quot; by Stacy Q.\n\n&quot;For the decade of the 70's, what was the number one soul song and what was the number one country song?&quot; Casey says the soul song was Al Green's first #1 while the country song was Charlie Rich's first #1.\n\nOne song in the top ten holds the record for most consecutive weeks, not at number one or number two, but for spending six weeks at number three.\n\nA movie theme song replaces another movie theme song in the number one spot, something Casey says has happened only one other time (in 1977 when &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; replaced the theme from &quot;Star Wars&quot; but the &quot;Star Wars&quot; song was by Meco and was not in the movie).\n\n40: Burnin' For You - Blue Oyster Cult\n39: In The Dark - Billy Squire\n38: The Old Songs - Barry Manilow\n37: Sausalito Summer Night - Diesel\n36: Lady (You Bring Me Up) - The Commodores\n35: (There's No Getting' Over Me) - Ronnie Milsap\n34: The Beach Boys Medley - The Beach Boys\n33: Alien - Atlanta Rhythm Section\n32: He's A Liar - Bee Gees\n31: Physical - Olivia Newton-John\n30: The Voice - The Moody Blues\nLDD: Just The Two Of Us - Grover Washington, Jr.\n29: Atlanta Lady - Marty Balin\n28: Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic - The Police\n27: Oh No - The Commodores\n26: Queen Of Hearts - Juice Newton\nARCHIVE: Hey Jude - The Beatles\n25: Waiting For A Girl Like You - Foreigner\n24: She's A Bad Mama Jama - Carl Carlton\n23: Here I Am - Air Supply\nARCHIVE: Love Child - Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes\n22: The Theme From &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; - Mike Post\n21: Just Once - Quincy Jones with James Ingram\n20: Say Goodbye To Hollywood - Billy Joel\n19: We're In This Love Together - Al Jarreau\n18: I Could Never Miss You - Lulu\n17: Super Freak - Rick James\n16: When She Was My Girl - Four Tops\n15: Share Your Love With Me - Kenny Rogers\n14: Tryin' To Live My Life Without You - Bob Seger\n13: Hold On Tight - E.L.O.\n12: I've Done Everything For You - Rick Springfield\n11: Urgent - Foreigner\n10: The Night Owls - The Little River Band\n9: Hard To Say - Dan Fogelberg\n8: Who's Crying Now - Journey\nLDD: The Way We Were - Barbra Streisand\n7: Stop Draggin' My Heart Around - Stevie Nicks W/ Tom Petty\n6: Private Eyes - Hall &amp; Oates\n5: Step By Step - Eddie Rabbitt\n4: For Your Eyes Only - Sheena Easton\n3: Start Me Up - The Rolling Stones\n2: Endless Love - Diana Ross &amp; Lionel Richie\n1: Arthur's Theme - Christopher Cross\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:642478ddf51e5833c284d5c63da24c1f906938e6","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1981_October_17th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"642478ddf51e5833c284d5c63da24c1f906938e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,36,120,221,245,30,88,51,194,132,213,198,61,162,76,31,144,105,56,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
