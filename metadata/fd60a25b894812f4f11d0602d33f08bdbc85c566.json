Yes has to be one of the best progressive rock bands around. Their music has touched my heart, and these live performaces are just spectacular. Here we have the Alan White on drums, replacing Bill Brufored during the Close to the Edge tour, Rick Wakeman on keyboards, with his amazing solo of &amp;#039;Excerpts from Wives of Henry..&amp;#039;, Chris Squire on bass, Steve Howe, performing &amp;#039;The Clap&amp;#039; furiously, and Jon Anderson on vocals, who never fails to prove that he has one of the most unique voices in the business. The best songs here, are &amp;#039;And You And I&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Yours Is No Disgrace&amp;#039;, and &amp;#039;Close to the Edge&amp;#039;. The only thing about &amp;#039;Close to the Edge&amp;#039; is that during the song, images of organisms and living cells and what not are shown, and it gets annoying especially during the awesome parts in the song. Also, songs like &amp;#039;Siberian Khatru&amp;#039;, and &amp;#039;Roundabout&amp;#039;, which was found on the CD, isn&amp;#039;t found on this film. Either way, the concert is awesome. Yessongs was also hard to find awhile ago, which was out of print for a time. But recently, Yessongs was rereleased on DVD. All Yes fans must see this film.\n\n\n[color=red]DVD Features:[/color]\nAvailable Subtitles: English\nAvailable Audio Tracks: Englisch (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo) \nTime ca. 77 Minuten Playtime, \n\n[color=yellow]Info:[/color][B]12 Hours .-. 50 kB/s[/B]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd60a25b894812f4f11d0602d33f08bdbc85c566","amp;dn":"Yes+-+Yessongs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd60a25b894812f4f11d0602d33f08bdbc85c566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,96,162,91,137,72,18,244,241,29,6,2,211,63,8,189,188,133,197,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
