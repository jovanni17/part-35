Art historian Janetta Rebold Benton uses examples such as the Book of Kells, Bury Saint Edmunds Cross, and the Bayeux Tapestry, and the work of artists such as Jan van Eyck and Giotto to explore the various media available to medieval artists and the ways in which those media were used to create a stunning array of masterworks.\nAlthough the visual arts of the Middle Ages were extremely colorful, today much of that color has diminished or disappeared, the pigments and threads faded, the gold abraded, the silver tarnished. Materials, Methods, and Masterpieces of Medieval Art allows these works to sparkle once more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c0bfccc56069a7bb0eaec0b8eddbfc442d8f7b2","amp;dn":"Materials%2C+Methods%2C+and+Masterpieces+of+Medieval+Art+%28Art+Histor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c0bfccc56069a7bb0eaec0b8eddbfc442d8f7b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,11,252,204,86,6,154,123,176,234,236,11,142,221,191,196,66,216,247,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
