Increasingly, the need to produce without pollution is the preferred model for industry, and the strategy of waste minimization is seen as the best way forward. This is particularly relevant in the petrochemical and chemical industries, where large quantities of hazardous and toxic wastes are produced which can pose formidable disposal problems.\r\n\r\nCovering the essentials of treatment, recovery and disposal of waste, as well as the requirements for process design and engineering of equipment and facilities in the chemical and petroleum industries, this book includes chapters on:\r\n\r\nWastewater Treatment\r\nPhysical Unit Operations\r\nChemical Treatment\r\nBiological Treatment\r\nWastewater Treatment in Unconventional Oil and Gas Industries\r\nWastewater Sewer Systems\r\nSewage Treatment\r\nSolid Waste Treatment and Disposal\r\n\r\nPrimarily aimed at researchers and advanced students in chemical, petroleum, and environmental fields as well as those in civil engineering, this book should also provide a unique reference for industry practitioners and anyone interested in chemical and petroleum waste treatment and disposal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c6bfd18e8d784c6fc401af811b2733584bdbfab","amp;dn":"Waste+Management+in+the+Chemical+and+Petroleum+Industries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c6bfd18e8d784c6fc401af811b2733584bdbfab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,107,253,24,232,215,132,198,252,64,26,248,17,178,115,53,132,189,191,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
