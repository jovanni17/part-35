It is a remake of the Nutmeg records, red vinyl High Live\nand Dirty LP from the early 80's. Yeah I know I rated it as 5 Stars. I'll explain in a minute.\nThis is without a doubt the worst collection of Jimi Hendrix &quot;music&quot; ever. The session was\ntaped in a New York night club in 1968 and like the title says Jimi must have been wasted\nthat night. Very wasted! He misses every note and forgets every line to every song. Song\nis probably the wrong word to use, there are no songs here, just a drug and booze\nsoaked jam session. His backing band is atrocious and it sounds like people keep\njumping up on stage and joining his band's attempt to make something that sounds like a\nsong. The comments caught on tape are pretty funny, you can just imagine the rowdy\nstoned out late 60's scene going down...you would probably appreciate this album alot\nmore if you do some 60's style drugs. It's flat out awful.\n\nHere is the good part. Jim Morrison was in attendence the night this was taped and he\njumps up on stage and tries to join in. He is even more wasted than Jimi Hendrix if you\ncan believe that. The song Morrison's Lament (also known as F.H.I.T.A.) is nothing more\nthan a drunken Morrison rolling around the floor of the stage repeating the words &quot; F*#k\nher in the assh@#le &quot;. He changes it up a little by saying &quot; F*#k her baby, in the\nassh@#le &quot; a few times.\n\nBack in the early 80's when I bought this album my buddies and I would sit around and\nget hammered listening to his good stuff like Axis Bold As Love or Are You\nExperienced...then after we were good and ripped we'd slap High Live and Dirty on....we\ncould not stop laughing. I used to hurt myself laughing at F.H.I.T.A, we'd play that damn\nsong over and over and over...and then eat about 100 bags of dorritos.\n\nYes the music sucks. But if you had a blast cracking up at over this album back in the day\nlike I did you gotta get it just to play F.H.I.T.A on your buddy's phone answering\nmachines.\n\nI love Jimi Hendrix music...but that ain't what this album is all about. I guess for\ncompletists you'd have to buy it, and if you actually want to hear Hendrix and Morrison on\nstage together ( as awful as it turned out) well here is your ticket. There are rumors that\nJohhny Winter played in this jam session (Hendrix mentions his name) but Winter himself\ndenies that he was there or ever even met Morrison. This albums blows unless you are\nlooking for a laugh. That's the truth man...No s#@t!\nreview By Richard P. Mayhew\n\nThis CD has been around forever and I can't believe that they are still suckering people\ninto buying this crap. The sound is horrible and the performance (if you can call it that) is\neven worse. If you like totally drunk musicians playing horribly, then by all means spend\nyour money on this crap. Yeah Jim Morrison is on it...but again it's a total waste of time\nand money. If I could have given this CD 0 stars I would have. This is the best example of\nwhat drugs and booze will do to you.\nreview By Robert T.
