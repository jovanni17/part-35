By far the most successful single from Off the Wall, the track also topped the charts in Australia and Norway, and reached the top 3 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK.\n\nThe music video made for &quot;Don?t Stop &amp;#039;til You Get Enough&quot; was directed and produced by Nick Saxton. It made its world premiere in October 1979, featuring a smiling Jackson floating over a background of disco lights performing physically complicated dance techniques while lip-synching to the song in a tuxedo. The track used for the video was the same edit used for the single, but including the spoken intro. Its length is 4:11.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c926c6e0da868eeadf73b9453000905f3f2eb14b","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Don%5C%27t+Stop+%5C%27Til+You+Get+Enough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c926c6e0da868eeadf73b9453000905f3f2eb14b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,38,198,224,218,134,142,234,223,115,185,69,48,0,144,95,63,46,177,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
