The analyses in the three previous volumes remain valid as far as they go, Voegelin explains, but the original conception proved &quot;untenable because it had not taken proper account of the important lines of meaning in history that did not run along lines of time.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:874581918353e2b5269148e4b2c7930b72cda264","amp;dn":"Order+and+History+%28Volume+4%29%3A+The+Ecumenic+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"874581918353e2b5269148e4b2c7930b72cda264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,69,129,145,131,83,226,181,38,145,72,228,178,199,147,11,114,205,162,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
