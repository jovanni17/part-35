The episode focuses on the aftermath of Lem's death, including his funeral and flashbacks as co-workers reflect upon Det. Lemansky's life.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIt is not the best quality, but considering I could not find it here on TPB, and only managed to find a complete copy of it buried in a complete series torrent elsewhere, this is the best I can do.\nSupposedly it is included on the Season 5 set, so if anyone rips a better version, please seed it do not forget to provide separate subtitles!) and drop your link here. Thanks!\n\nAVI, roughly 110MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2687a97170d8d98d28522a176f7c4ac785d49baa","amp;dn":"The+Shield+-+Season+5%2FSeason+6+promosode+%5C%22Wins+and+Losses%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2687a97170d8d98d28522a176f7c4ac785d49baa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,135,169,113,112,216,217,141,40,82,42,23,111,124,74,199,133,212,155,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
