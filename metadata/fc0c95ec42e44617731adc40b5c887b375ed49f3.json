Yoshikawa - Food Factors for Health Promotion\nEnglish | 2009-04-30 | ISBN: 3805590970 | PDF | 224 pages | 3 MB\n\nFood factors are considered to be critical for human health promotion and play an important role in the prevention of life-style related diseases. One of the major challenges in this context is to determine the multiple factors associated with the causes of these diseases, as well as to develop a method of detecting changes in the initial stage and to establish a diagnostic approach that can be used in prevention studies of food factors.\n\nThis publication features chapters on genomics, proteomics, bioavailability and safety, antioxidants, life-style related diseases and on chemoprevention and cancer. Basic scientists with a focus on food factors, clinicians planning a prospective preventive study of food factors in life-style-related diseases, as well as company researchers studying health promotional effects of food or food ingredients will find a wealth of information in this book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc0c95ec42e44617731adc40b5c887b375ed49f3","amp;dn":"Food+Factors+for+Health+Promotion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc0c95ec42e44617731adc40b5c887b375ed49f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,12,149,236,66,228,70,23,115,26,220,64,181,200,135,179,117,237,73,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
