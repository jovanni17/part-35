It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just about building a technology stack.\n\nThis course introduces the idea of software engineering as an iterative, systematic process. You will learn to use Github and Eclipse as you get introduced to the development life cycle, design processes and software testing.\n\nSoftware Development Processes will show you the skills and processes needed to complement technical understanding of software products in order to make you a more effective developer in an engineering team.\n\nPrerequisites and Requirements\n\nA strong familiarity with Android development (perhaps through Developing Android Apps) is expected.\n\nSee the Technology Requirements for using Udacity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0d9cdc513a7ba560f3205238aadbd8907990857","amp;dn":"Udacity+-+Software+Development+Process","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0d9cdc513a7ba560f3205238aadbd8907990857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,217,205,197,19,167,186,86,15,50,5,35,138,173,189,137,7,153,8,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
