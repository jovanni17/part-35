Anything you see can be broken down and rebuilt elsewhere. Craft items, build structures, set traps and dig deep underground in search of precious resources to help your gnomes survive the harsh lands. Build your kingdom and stockpile wealth to attract wandering gnomads to your cause, but be wary of also attracting enemies! \n\nGnomoria v0.8.35\n\nGeneral\n\n-Import/Export Professions\n-When importing Professions, old Professions with the same name will update to the new one.
