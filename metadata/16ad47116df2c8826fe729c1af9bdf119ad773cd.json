The log is continuously available and updated on the internet. \nInstead of showing a persons name next to the coin they \nown, the log shows the public key of the person who owns the coin. \nAnyone who wants to prove they own the coin simply has to produce\nthe matching private key, and its theirs.  Once a coin is spent, the \nlog is updated to show the most recent transaction, and the log shows the \nperson receiving the coin now owns it, since the coin now has a new public\nkey with it. In general, users will create a new public and private key for each\ncoin they own to ensure nobody inspecting the log can infer that a single person\nowns multiple coins. \n\nSome crypto currencies are designed to have a fixed amount of currency, such as \nBitcoin that caps at 21 million coins.   Ripple uses the opencoin protocol, and \nhas 100 billion coins.  In both cases, it is impossible to change the currency\nlimit without consent of all users of the system.\n\nSome crypto currencies are designed to ensure anonymity, some are not. \nBitcoin ensures anonymity provided each coin has a unique public and private key. \nThere is literally no way to determine who owns what coin.   The fact that bitcoins\nare anonymous makes them attractive for transactions that are inherently illegal. \nIt also means that governments cannot collect taxes on those transactions. \nRipple is different, it provides a tracking database available to government \nauthorities to track all transactions, and see who owns what. \n\nBitcoins are bearer notes, meaning they are irrevokable once spent. \nFor a person accepting payment using bitcoins, there is no counterparty-risk, \nmeaning there is no way for a disappointed purchaser to rollback a transaction \nto get their money back. Once its spent, its spent. \n\nBitcoin transactions are much like debit card transactions, except no trusted\n3rd party is involved, thus no bank.   The transaction cost for a bitcoin transaction\nare also negligible, on the order of a hundredth of a penny.  \n\nThe fact that accepting bitcoins is very low cost for a seller, with no counter-party\nrisk means many vendors will be inclined to accept them.  This is a threat to \nsovereign governments who lose sales tax revenue, and ultimately lose income tax revenue. \nWith more ways to spend bitcoins, they become more liquid, and this will increase demand\nfor them, further increasing their utility as a currency, and further enabling bitcoins to \nbe used to make illicit payments.   In addition, central banks make lots of money by \nprinting currency (at near zero cost), and then lending it out and charging interest.  \nThis very profitable aspect of central bank operations is also at risk if an \nindependent crypto currency became a significant part of the money supply of a country.\n\nThus central governments (who own central banks) will certainly prohibit transactions \nusing bitcoins or any cryptocurrency that they do not issue.\n\nTo suppress demand for such independent cryptocurrency, central banks will eventually \nissue their own, but they will not have a cap on the coins issued, thus allowing \nthem to continue &quot;managing&quot; the money supply.  They will also keep track of who owns \neach coin, thus discouraging tax evasion and discouraging payment for illicit goods.\n\nThe banking sector will lobby against issuing a state sanctioned cryptocurrecy, since it \ncanabalizes their debit card business.  Eventually the banks will establish themselves as the\nprime nodes producing and updating the public log, and for that they will charge a fee \nthat produces enough revenue for them, that they will assist the central bank to roll out \nthe new cryptocurrency. \n\n-- freeflow123\n\nThis release covers... \n\nA Tale of Two Cities\nA Tree Grows in Brooklyn\nA Very Old Man with Enormous Wings\nA View from the Bridge\nA Wrinkle in Time\nA Yellow Raft in Blue Water\nTender is the Night\nTess of the dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Urbervilles\nThe Taming of the Shrew\nThe Tempest\nThe Things They Carried\nThe Three Musketeers\nThe Time Machine\nThe Trial\nThe Turn of the Screw\nThe Two Gentlemen of Verona\nThe Two Towers\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Being\nThe Unvanquished\nThe Waves\nThe Winter's Tale\nThe Woman Warrior\nThe Women of Brewster Place\nThe Year of Magical Thinking\nThe Yellow Wallpaper\nTheir Eyes Were Watching God\nThings Fall Apart\nThis Boy's Life\nThis Side of Paradise\nThree Cups of Tea\nThrough the Looking Glass\nTimon of Athens\nTitus Andronicus\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\nTo the Lighthouse\nTom Jones\nTortilla Flat\nTreasure Island\nTristram Shandy\nTroilus and Cressida\nTrue West\nTuesdays with Morrie\nTwelfth Night\nTwilight of the Superheroes\nTypee\nUlysses\nUncle TomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cabin\nUncle Vanya\nVirgin Suicides\nVolpone\nWaiting for Godot\nWalden Two\nWalden\nWalk Two Moons\nWar and Peace\nWarriors DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Cry\nWatership Down\nWhat We Talk About When We Talk About Love\nWhen Heaven and Earth Changed Places\nWhen the Legends Die\nWhere Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\nWhere the Red Fern Grows\nWhite Fang\nWhite Noise\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\nWhy I Live at the P.O.\nWide Sargasso Sea\nWinesburg, Ohio\nWinter Dreams\nWoman at Point Zero\nWuthering Heights\nYoung Goodman Brown\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16ad47116df2c8826fe729c1af9bdf119ad773cd","amp;dn":"Book+Analysis+Reports%2C+for+literature+with+titles+from+T+to+Z%2C+f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16ad47116df2c8826fe729c1af9bdf119ad773cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,173,71,17,109,242,200,130,111,231,41,193,175,155,223,17,154,215,115,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
