Notable national hits included &quot;Pressure Sway&quot;, &quot;My Heart's On Fire&quot; and &quot;No Say In It&quot;.  Their first two releases originally had a very new wavish, trancey, almost goth sound, not unlike Siouxsie &amp; The Banshees Juju or The Cure's Seventeen Seconds. But the meteoric rise of &quot;Pressure Sway&quot; (a very dancey single lifted from the Esteem album) propelled the Machinations in a new direction. They got themselves a fulltime drummer and produced Big Music, a tight 10 track collection of boppy, edgy, dancey tunes. [This issue has 3 bonus tracks and re-mixes]\n\nAt least four singles were lifted, with &quot;My Heart's On Fire&quot;, &quot;No Say In It&quot; and &quot;You Got Me Going Again&quot; all becoming massive hits both in their native Australia and overseas (&quot;Execution of Love&quot; was the fourth single). Amongst these massively hook-laden tunes was still some of the band's trademark dark &amp; moody residue as a leftover from their earlier days with tracks such as &quot;Spark&quot; (a haunting goth-like ballad) and &quot;5 Minutes Black&quot;, plus &quot;The Letter&quot; which was more than a little reggae-inspired. \n\n\n  \n01 My Heart's on Fire    \n02 Predator    \n03 Jabber    \n04 Execution of Love    \n05 Spark    \n06 No Say in It    \n07 Don't Take Me    \n08 You Got Me Going Again    \n09 5 Minutes Black    \n10 The Letter \n11 One Step Closer\n12 Man Over Board\n13 Dusted Down\n14 I Ain't Waitin' For No Train\n15 Execution Of Love (Extended)\n16 My Hearts On Fire (Extended)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a839b2b534188abdeb436b89c700be60fed97910","amp;dn":"Machinations+-+Big+Music+%5B1985%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a839b2b534188abdeb436b89c700be60fed97910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,57,178,181,52,24,138,189,235,67,107,137,199,0,190,96,254,217,121,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
