The original game is filled with out-there touches such as a bizarre plot featuring sponge worlds that can be bulldozed however you see fit and nanotech units that morph like pint-sized Transformers. While Emperor's Testament is another solid, supremely strange RTS, Russian developer K-D Lab has stuck to the template of the 2004 original and made it a straightforward expansion. This is one of those don't-fix-it-if-it-ain't-broken add-ons that builds on the old story, themes, and settings. The game is a collection of new maps and missions that stretch the original campaign in a new direction, so only fans of the first game need apply.\n\n\nThere is a fine line between being overly weird and being innovative. Perimeter: EmperorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Testament is the fat turkey that sits way over on both sides.
