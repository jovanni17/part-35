This angst-driven portrait of four typical teenagers (non-actors) exposes a systematic pattern of negligence and exploitation by government, big business, schools and parents concerning the food they eat. In a climate where media attention is primarily on childhood obesity, first-time Director, Jennifer Mattox looks at the big picture - a system that preys upon consumer innocence in the name of profit. The filmmakers make a direct connection between what teens eat and their behavior and emotions. This poignant and comedic film opens eyes to the life-threatening truths that must be addressed.
