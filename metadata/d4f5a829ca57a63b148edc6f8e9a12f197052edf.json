There isn't any &quot;Pink Girl with the Blues,&quot; &quot;Hell Above Water,&quot; or &quot;Stripped Out&quot; here, so don't get too excited.  But that voice is unmistakable.  This is almost everything she released during those days.  I think there's just one other b-side and some remixes missing.\n\nHearts and Handshakes - 1989\n\nTime Turns Around     3:40   \nCut Up     4:32   \nLove Attraction     3:55   \nMake A Wish     4:02   \nWelcome To Heaven     3:30   \nOde To Anna     3:04   \nWoman In Mind     3:26   \nWeekday     3:58   \nI Want More     3:50   \nTales Of Tomorrow     3:46   \nPrice You Have To Pay     3:49   \nHearts And Handshakes     6:12   \n\n****************************************\n\nWeekday (single) - 1988\n\nGet Out Of The Rain     4:17   \nTop Of The Tree     3:50   \nWeekday (Extended Version)     6:20  \n\n****************************************\n\nTime Turns Around (single) - 1989\n\nDull Man     4:32 \n\n****************************************\n\nWoman In Mind (single) - 1989\n\nChemical Comedown     3:42 \n\n****************************************\n\n\nmp3 format\n\n***********************\n\nGrab and go is never cool.  Please help keep these torrents alive.  Whenever you grab a torrent, you should continue to seed for others, at least until your ratio reaches 1.0 or higher.  I'm still kind of new to this, but I believe that if you make any changes to what you've downloaded or move them from their original download location, it will stop seeding.  I usually COPY my music files from my download folder to an empty folder on my desktop, rename them how I like, then add them to my music library.  This leaves the torrent in its original condition and location so it will seed for others.\n\nWe've all been frustrated by dead and incomplete torrents.  This wouldn't happen if everyone seeded until their ratio got over 1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4f5a829ca57a63b148edc6f8e9a12f197052edf","amp;dn":"Toni+Halliday+-++Hearts+and+Handshakes+and+b-sides+++Curve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4f5a829ca57a63b148edc6f8e9a12f197052edf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,245,168,41,202,87,166,59,20,142,220,111,142,154,18,241,151,5,46,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
