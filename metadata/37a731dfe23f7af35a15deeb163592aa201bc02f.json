She was involved in extramarital affairs with two men and eventually the double standards that women suffer by catch up with her (but not with the married suitors), and dogged media slander her reputation. With her honor at stake, she sees no recourse but to commit suicide, and does so with an overdose of barbiturates. According to the wikipedia entry about her (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruan_Ling_Yu), &quot;her funeral procession was reportedly three miles long, with three women committing suicide during it.&quot;\n\nPreviews &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAOmDAAdm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAOmDAAdm&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAOmCAAdM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAOmCAAdM&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAoMeAaDM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAoMeAaDM&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PaomFAADM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PaomFAADM&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37a731dfe23f7af35a15deeb163592aa201bc02f","amp;dn":"Center+Stage+%28Ruan+Ling-Yu+%2F+Yuen+Ling-yuk%29+-+1992+-+Stanley+Kwa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37a731dfe23f7af35a15deeb163592aa201bc02f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,167,49,223,226,63,122,243,90,21,222,235,22,53,146,170,32,27,192,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
