With guitarist Richie Sambora and songwriter Desmond Child, Jon Bon Jovi has produced a slew of consistently memorable tunes,\nand this album contains its fair share of them. Slippery When Wet won't change your world, but it will, undoubtedly, rock it. --Ronita Dutta\n\nThis is a REMASTERED recording from original CD.
