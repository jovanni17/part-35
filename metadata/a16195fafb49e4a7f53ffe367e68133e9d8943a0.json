At a party, he finds his girlfriend having sex with his best friend. He soon finds that his  pot-smoking, ex-hippie parents have donated his college savings account to a televangelist, supposedly to supply Bibles to El  Salvador. Depressed and broke, Otto falls in with Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) a seasoned repossession agent, or &quot;repo man&quot;,  working for the disingenuously named &quot;Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation&quot;, a small-time automobile repossession agency.  While repelled by the concept at first, Otto's opinion is rapidly changed when he is paid cash for his first &quot;job.&quot;\nOtto soon learns that &quot;the life of a repo man is always intense.&quot; He enjoys the drug use, real-life car chases, the thrill of  hot-wiring cars and good pay. His old punk rock lifestyle seems boring by comparison, and he begins to develop a rapport with  his fellow repo men as well. When he returns to a punk club to see a lounge act (played by real-life hardcore band Circle  Jerks), he is amazed at how terrible they now seem.\nSoon, Bud, Otto and competing repo men all over town are searching for a 1964 Chevrolet Malibu from New Mexico, ludicrously  overvalued at $20,000 (about $41,000 in 2007 dollars); this vehicle, unknown to them, contains something mysterious and  dangerously powerful in its trunk, also sought by a strange female FBI agent, Agent Rogersz (Susan Barnes) and her staff.\nThe film draws on the experiences of director Alex Cox, who worked briefly as a repossession agent in Los Angeles, but soon  deviates into the surreal with aliens, the CIA, punk rocker thieves and other strange characters and situations, all amid a  long string of running gags and almost-impossible coincidences.\n\n\nCREW\nDirector..........Alex Cox \nWriter............Alex Cox  \nProducer..........Peter McCarthy, Michael Nesmith   \n\nCAST\nEmilio Estevez......Otto Maddox \nHarry Dean Stanton..Bud \nFox Harris..........J.
