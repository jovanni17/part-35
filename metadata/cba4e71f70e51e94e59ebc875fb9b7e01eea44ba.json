Led by Shane MacGowan, whose slurred, incomprehensible voice often disguised the sheer poetry of his songs, the Pogues were undeniably political -- not only were many of their songs explicitly in favor of working-class liberalism, but the wild, careening sound of their punk-injected folk was implicitly radical. While the band was clearly radical, they also had a wickedly warped sense of humor, which was abundantly clear on their biggest hit, the fractured Christmas carol &quot;Fairy Tale of New York.&quot; The group's first three albums -- Red Roses for Me, Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash, If I Should Fall from Grace with God -- were widely praised in both Britain and America, and by 1988 they had earned substantial cult followings in both countries. Yet MacGowan's darkly romantic, wasted lifestyle, which was so key to their spirit and success, ultimately proved to be their downfall. By the end of the decade, he had fallen deep into alcoholism and drug addiction, forcing the band to fire him if they wanted to survive. The Pogues carried on without him in the early '90s, playing to a slowly shrinking audience before finally disbanding in 1996. \n\nArtist...............: The Pogues\nAlbum................: 30:30 The Essential Collection\nGenre................: Irish Folk\nSource...............: CD {Rhino #5053105660353}\nYear.................: 2013\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 72 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 3/15/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO, LOG, CUE, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front Back CD \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       CD1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
