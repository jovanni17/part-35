Known as hard rock, it was loud, tough, energetic and sometimes\ndark in outlook. They didn't know it, but Deep Purple, Uriah Heep and,\nmost significantly, Black Sabbath were defining what first became heavy\nrock and then eventually heavy metal.\n\nInspired by blues rock, progressive rock, classical music and high energy\nAmerican rock, they synthesised the sound that would inspire bands like\nJudas Priest to take metal even further during the 70s.\n\nBy the 80s its originators had fallen foul of punk rock, creative stasis\nor drug and alcohol abuse. But a new wave of British heavy metal was ready\nto take up the crusade. With the success of bands like Iron Maiden,\nit went global.\n\nContributors include Lemmy, Sabbath's Tony Iommi, Ian Gillan from\nDeep Purple, Judas Priest singer Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson from\nIron Maiden and Saxon's Biff Byford.\n\n\n\nFORMAT:.......................: MKV\nCODEC:........................: X264\nFILE SIZE:....................: 447 MiB\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*406=16:9\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\nAUDIO MP2: ...................: 256 Kbps\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\nRUNTIME:......................: 1h 29mn\nENCODER:......................: oneanight\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b0dd89fcbb1da4d680588a9492844016a005df5","amp;dn":"Metal+Britannia+x264+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b0dd89fcbb1da4d680588a9492844016a005df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,13,216,159,203,177,218,77,104,5,136,169,73,40,68,1,106,0,93,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
