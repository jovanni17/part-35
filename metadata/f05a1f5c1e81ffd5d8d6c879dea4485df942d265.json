The system includes numerous changes related primarily to Modern UI and Modern Apps in the OS.\n\nThe file name of the leaked image is 9364.0.FBL_PARTNER_OUT13.130315-2105_X86FRE_CLIENT. As is obvious from the build tag, it was compiled on March 15, 2013 and has been designed exclusively for Microsoft's partners. The size of the ISO image is 2.63 GB.\n\nInstallation Key:\n=================\n\n\n\nMTWNQ-CKDHJ-3HXW9-Q2PFX-WB2HQ \n\n\n\n\nHASH Values:\n============\n\nMD5 - 4d72d338fd2fc854e8edb312a4a98892\n\nSHA-1 - 179b588dfc21ccf4b76b7e9be505a51d00f52d6f\n\nCRC-32 - 81a4b9f0\n\n\n\nThe main changes are as follows:\n\n    It is possible to snap/arrange two Modern-applications side by side at 50/50% ratio,\n    Several new bundled Modern Apps (such as alarm clock, calculator, and sound recorder),\n    Two versions of live tiles - small (as present in Windows Phone 8) and large rectangular ones (occupying two rows),\n    Extended personalization settings\n    The ability to backup the settings of the working environment to SkyDrive.\n\nAlso 'PC Settings' have been updated, featuring new options which allow a hierarchical way of navigation between Modern apps.\n\nThere are some changes to the Charms Bar:\n\n    The &quot;Devices&quot; charm now has an option for Play To,\n    You can now share a screenshot of the running application via the &quot;Share&quot; charm.\n\nThe leaked build lacks access to the Windows Store, and it is not possible to activate it.\n\n\nThe kernel version is 6.3:\n\n\nMore INFO at the link below:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://winaero.com/blog/windows-blue-version-6-3-9364-has-leaked-on-the-internet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://winaero.com/blog/windows-blue-version-6-3-9364-has-leaked-on-the-internet/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
