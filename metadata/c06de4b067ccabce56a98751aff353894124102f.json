Featured as the theme to the romantic comedy film Mannequin, it hit #1 in the Billboard Hot 100 on April 4, 1987 and reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart for four weeks the following month. At the time, it made Grace Slick the oldest female artist to have a number one single in the United States (though the record was later broken by Cher&amp;#039;s &quot;Believe&quot; in 1999). The song also received an Oscar nomination for &quot;Best Original Song&quot; at the 60th Academy Awards. It was released in the album No Protection in 1987.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c06de4b067ccabce56a98751aff353894124102f","amp;dn":"Starship+-+Nothing%5C%27s+Gonna+Stop+Us+Now","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c06de4b067ccabce56a98751aff353894124102f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,109,228,176,103,204,171,206,86,169,135,81,175,243,83,137,65,36,16,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
