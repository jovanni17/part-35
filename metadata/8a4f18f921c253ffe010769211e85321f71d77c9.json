Barnes was a prominent American historian in the 20th century. Associated for virtually his entire career with Columbia University, Barnes is considered to have been a pioneer of historical revisionism, meaning the use of historical scholarship to challenge and refute the narratives of history promulgated by the state and the elite, most often in opposition to Whig history or as Barnes himself termed it, &quot;court history&quot;. The lessons learned from the study of Pearl Harbor event are even more relevant today as the world is still recovering from the 2nd Pearl Harbor, namely 11.september 2001. Once again the leaders of the world were trying to convince everybody that it came as a total surprise. Is history simply repeating itself once again? 90 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a4f18f921c253ffe010769211e85321f71d77c9","amp;dn":"Barnes-Pearl+Harbor+After+Quarter+of+Century%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a4f18f921c253ffe010769211e85321f71d77c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,79,24,249,33,194,83,255,224,16,118,146,17,232,83,33,247,29,119,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
