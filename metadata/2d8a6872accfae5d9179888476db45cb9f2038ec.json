Their self-titled EP produced and recorded by Dave Otero of Flatline Audio, (Cephalic Carnage, Matriden) has been hailed by many as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Colorado Talent to keep on the RadarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. In 2010, they released their first full album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fragments of Form and FunctionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nAllegaeon consists of Guitarists (Ryan Glisan and Greg Burgess), Bassist (Corey Archuleta), Percussionist (Jordan Belfast) and Vocalist (Ezra Haynes). All five of the Fierce players have been extensively involved with music throughout their lives and have made music their career of choice.\n\nWith an array of shows under their belt and the focus of absolute domination on their minds, the members of Allegaeon are poised to break from the ever growing scene in Colorado. Through hard work and dedication, Allegaeon is primed and ready to make a statement both Regionally, Nationally, and WorldwideÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.Welcome to the DAWN OF METAL, Welcome to ALLEGAEON.\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nGreg Burgess - Guitars\nJordon Belfast - Drums\nCorey Archuleta - Bass\nRyan Glisan - Guitar\nEzra Haynes - Vocals\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
