It gives physicists a fresh outlook and new ways of handling quantum-mechanical problems, and also leads to improved approximation techniques for dealing with potentials of interest in all branches of physics. The algebraic approach to obtaining eigenstates is elegant and important, and all physicists should become familiar with this.\n\nThe book has been written in such a way that it can be easily appreciated by students in advanced undergraduate quantum mechanics courses. Problems have been given at the end of each chapter, along with complete solutions to all the problems. The text also includes material of interest in current research not usually discussed in traditional courses on quantum mechanics, such as the connection between exact solutions to classical soliton problems and isospectral quantum Hamiltonians, and the relation to the inverse scattering problem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f66cd4dd96178b6a3dbd8aa06c4264f8df5ce2dd","amp;dn":"Supersymmetry+in+Quantum+Mechanics+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f66cd4dd96178b6a3dbd8aa06c4264f8df5ce2dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,108,212,221,150,23,139,106,61,189,138,160,108,66,100,248,223,92,226,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
