As the kings of earnest country-inflected ...    Full Descriptionrock in an age when radical stances were de rigueur, CCR sported straight-ahead tunes, and may have seemed a bit unhip. But their music stands the test of time with a vengeance. For the doubtful listener, this outstanding, 20-track hits collection has evidence of their greatness in staggering abundance.\n\nThough they produced several excellent albums, Creedence was predominantly a singles band, and CHRONICLE compiles many of their biggest hits. From the slowly building saunter of &quot;Suzie Q&quot; and the spooky, R&amp;B-soaked &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; to the fierce &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; and the swampy blues of &quot;Run Through the Jungle,&quot; CHRONICLE features the ensemble&amp;#039;s signature tunes. Beautifully melancholy songs &quot;Who&amp;#039;ll Stop the Rain&quot; and &quot;Someday Never Comes&quot; play off sunny, melodic anthems &quot;Down on the Corner&quot; and &quot;Lookin&amp;#039; Out My Back Door,&quot; fully revealing the band&amp;#039;s wide range. The group&amp;#039;s tight, no-frills musicianship leaves John Fogerty&amp;#039;s keening voice and superb songwriting at the fore, and the results--brought together here on one of rock&amp;#039;s best greatest-hits packages--make for some of the genre&amp;#039;s most endearing and enduring music.\n\nRecorded 1968-1970 and includes &amp;#039;Susie Q&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;I Put a Spell on You&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Proud Mary&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Bad Moon Rising&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Lodi&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Green River&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Commotion&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Down on the Corner&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Fortunate Son&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Travelin&amp;#039; Band&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Who&amp;#039;ll Stop the Rain&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Up Around the Bend&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Run Through the Jungle&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Lookin&amp;#039; Out My Back Door&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Long as I Can See the Light&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Hey Tonight&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Sweet Hitch-Hiker&amp;#039; &amp; &amp;#039;Someday Never Comes&amp;#039;. Fantasy label. 1991.\n\nIncludes liner notes by Greil Marcus.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival: John Fogerty (vocals, guitar); Tom Fogerty (guitar); Stu Cook (bass); Doug Clifford (drums).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b10b9687e7a11c9cc24af387eccb5d30450d8cc","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival+Chronicle%3A+The+20+Greatest+Hits+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b10b9687e7a11c9cc24af387eccb5d30450d8cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,16,185,104,126,122,17,201,204,36,175,56,126,204,181,211,4,80,216,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
