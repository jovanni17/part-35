In one example of the rich and magical world Kennedy serves up in four stories (totaling more than an hour of storytelling with one brief Irish musical interlude), pigs can't stop dancing (&quot;Annie O'Reilly and the Magic Dancing Pig&quot;). Of course, underlying this 16-minute fable is a sly critique, as the king of England wants this prized pig as his own and is wont to take things, but the pig eludes royal grasp. Kennedy proves again she's an accomplished seanachie (that's Gaelic for storyteller). Her voice is rich, warm, and musical as she spins imaginative foibles such as Tommy O'Rourke's visit to the moon, or as she delightfully relates an abridged version of the old Beowulf yarn in &quot;Finn McCool.&quot; In the age of Harry Potter's magical adventures--and way too much TV watching--here's a grand listening exercise for children that will capture their heads and hearts while hopefully helping to keep their ears on. --Martin Keller\n\nProduct Description\nSharon Kennedy's tales take children to a world of giants and kings, magical journeys and dancing pigs. It's a world where cleverness counts and where might doesn't make right. Following up her award-winning album Irish Folk Tales for Children, the Grammy-nominated storyteller presents four more tales from the rich Irish tradition. Irish music weaves in and out of the stories, enhancing the spell which Sharon Kennedy casts. &quot;You'll hang on every word of Sharon Kennedy, an Irish American whose ear for the auld sod's brogue is as unerring as her instinct for an engrossing yarn.&quot; -Moira McCormick, Family Fun\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cace867bb96b04eef8353d7c56ced907f512defb","amp;dn":"Sharon+Kennedy+-+More+Irish+Folk+Tales+For+Children+%5BV2%5D+stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cace867bb96b04eef8353d7c56ced907f512defb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,206,134,123,185,107,4,238,248,53,61,124,86,206,217,7,245,18,222,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
