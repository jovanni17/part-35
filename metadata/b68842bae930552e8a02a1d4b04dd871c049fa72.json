They talk about how they deal with raccoons, neighbors, and the various laws applying to livestock in the city.  How do you get bunnies to mow your lawn and weed your garden without eating your crops? What happens when they walk their goats around the block so they get enough exercise?   While they are telling you how they practice sustainable chemical free farming in a downtown city environment, the children playing with the animals are delightful.  Good quality 740x480 MPEG video format.  Recorded at a garden show in August of 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b68842bae930552e8a02a1d4b04dd871c049fa72","amp;dn":"Green+Fairy+Farmers+sustainable+garden+and+livestock+in+Berkeley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b68842bae930552e8a02a1d4b04dd871c049fa72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,136,66,186,233,48,85,46,138,2,161,212,176,77,216,113,192,73,250,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
