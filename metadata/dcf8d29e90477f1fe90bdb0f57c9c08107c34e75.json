To his surprise, however, his quarry - a renowned big game hunter - comes directly to him, and as Watson slips away to get the police, an impromptu game of cat and mouse ensues. This is Holmes at his most creative and debonair. The hunter becomes the hunted, and the exchange between the two, before Doyle uncorks a truly startling endgame, is a pure delight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcf8d29e90477f1fe90bdb0f57c9c08107c34e75","amp;dn":"The+Adventure+of+the+Mazarin+Stone+by+Sir+Arthur+Conan+Doyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcf8d29e90477f1fe90bdb0f57c9c08107c34e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,248,210,158,144,71,127,31,233,11,219,15,87,201,192,129,7,195,78,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
