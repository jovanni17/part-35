The music doesn't usually work on newer systems with newer dvd players (special cd players with a sound thingy were half-needed, same for their drivers) and running the custom in-game player will trigger / manage the music tracks instead of the game trying to use a non-existing part of a sound driver / cd player driver. You can find me using it on youtube by browsing youtube and searching for Heroes 2 Templayer. (The opera version of the OST in the Sorceress castle is so great!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd3931cc6e9ae6aee5a1eabeb70604c545080239","amp;dn":"Heroes+II+OST+%2B+a+Special+In-Game+Player","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd3931cc6e9ae6aee5a1eabeb70604c545080239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,57,49,204,110,154,230,174,229,161,234,190,183,6,4,197,69,8,2,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
