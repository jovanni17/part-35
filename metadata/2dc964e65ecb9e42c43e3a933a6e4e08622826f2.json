See the full release notes on the developer web page for details.\n\n[b]Overview:[/b]\n A full 5-row keyboard including arrow and Esc/Ctrl keys, intended for tablets.\n\nAre you missing the key layout youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re used to from your computer? This keyboard has separate number keys, punctuation in the usual places, and arrow keys. It is based on the AOSP Gingerbread soft keyboard, so it supports multitouch for the modifier keys.\n\nThis keyboard is especially useful if you use ConnectBot for SSH access. It provides working Tab/Ctrl/Esc keys, and the arrow keys are essential for devices such as the Xoom tablet or Nexus S that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a trackball or D-Pad.\n\nHAVE FEEDBACK, QUESTIONS, OR BUG REPORTS?

It uses the contacts information for completion of names and email addresses, and audio recording for the voice input feature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dc964e65ecb9e42c43e3a933a6e4e08622826f2","amp;dn":"Hacker_s_Keyboard_1.29.apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dc964e65ecb9e42c43e3a933a6e4e08622826f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,201,100,230,94,203,158,66,196,62,58,147,58,110,78,8,98,40,38,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
