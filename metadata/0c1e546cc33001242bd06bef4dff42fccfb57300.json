Been and Musick were originally from Oklahoma.\nCritically acclaimed (by their peers, such as Bono and Peter Gabriel, and critics) the band only ever reached cult status publicly. Mostly known for The Walls Came Down from &amp;#039;82&amp;#039; and Let the Day Begin (&amp;#039;89&amp;#039;.)\n\nAlbums details\nBest of The Mercury years excludes only a few tracks from the groups first three albums (The Call, Modern Romans and Scene Beyond Dreams... which were only released on vinyl.) The Best of the Call (&amp;#039;97) is not included here but there is only two or three previously unreleased &amp;#039;The Call&amp;#039; tracks on that album anyway. Apart from this all commercially released tracks by The Call are here.\n\n Year\tAlbum Title\t\t       Source    Rate\tID Tagged\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(Kbps)\n&amp;#039;82-84 \tBest of The Mercury Years \t(CD)   Mp3 192     Yes\n&amp;#039;82-84 \tBest of The Mercury Years\t(LP)   Mp3 320\t   Yes\n&amp;#039;86    \tReconciled \t\t\t(CD)   Mp3 320\t   Yes\n&amp;#039;87\tInto The Woods\t\t\t(CD)   Mp3 320\t   Yes\n&amp;#039;89\tLet the Day Begin\t\t(CD)   Mp3 320\t   Yes\n&amp;#039;90\tRed Moon\t\t\t(CD)   Mp3 320\t   Yes\n&amp;#039;97\tTo Heaven and Back\t\t(CD)   Mp3 192\t   Yes \n&amp;#039;00\tLive Under The Red Moon\t\t(CD)   Mp3 320\t   Yes\n\nTechnical\nMP3Gain (http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/) was used to tag (non-destructive) songs with APEv2 - players use this tag to play all songs at same perceived volume (no, this is not the same as normalizing, but superior). In this case the volume used was 90.6db (optimum volume before clipping). If you change any ID data you will likely find a difference in volume between songs. You will not need an audio editor to fix this, just switchoff/delete the APEv2 tag on all tracks or retag with mp3gain. \nRecommended player Winamp5.5x. to access and/or remove all these tags if it is your desire.\n\nRelated Websites of interest: Biograhphy/discography &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://the-call-band.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://the-call-band.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_(band)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_(band)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://members.tripod.com/kdrew/the/call-discography.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://members.tripod.com/kdrew/the/call-discography.html&lt;/a&gt; (order albums here)\n\nIf you enjoy this band please buy their albums.
