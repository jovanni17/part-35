(Less being 160 kbps and super being 320 kbps and joint stereo)\n\n -Version 2.0820 Works on latest OS as of now Mavericks.\n\n\n*I'd highly recommend this for those odd file types you come across when you can't find your music as an mp3 and want the best possible conversion. \n\nOf course From flac to mp3 320 would be the best possible conversion to mp3 as far as I know. \n\nIt's good for knowing you're getting the best quality conversions of listening to your music besides flac which you could do with VLC media player.*  \n\n\nIf you're nervous about downloading, start with just the png files which are screenshots of the app and what everything looks like.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments feel free to ask.\n\nSEED and ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0724682dda7732a771d6dab94529c33036acdd9c","amp;dn":"All2MP3+Converter+Mac+%2ALatest+Update%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0724682dda7732a771d6dab94529c33036acdd9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,36,104,45,218,119,50,167,113,214,218,185,69,41,195,48,54,172,221,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
