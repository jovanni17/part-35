As much a memoir as a primer on the vicissitudes of an actorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, the book is a collage based on real-life situations that offer touching insights into stars like Rita Hayworth, and into the practical magic that informs LangellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature sensibility.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The New Yorker)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Rarely have I read a book about celebrities that is as insightful, candid, revealing, and as well-written as this one. Frank LangellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir is not the usual authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ego trip, but rather his remembrances of the many accomplished men and women that he has come to know.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Gay Talese, author of A Writer's Life)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A delightfully unabashed page-turner about people we wish we had known in the throes of work, love, and growing old.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (A.R. Gurney, award-winning playwright)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Engaging. . . .Not just LangellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“famous people I have known,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but a heartfelt love letter to the theater and to the days when stars were stars, not merely celebrities.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Kirkus Reviews)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dropped Names is a sizzling platter of stellar vignettesÃ¢â‚¬â€pungent, for sure, but poignant too. . . . Mr. Langella is surgically precise, and eloquent. . . . The human condition in most of its vagaries is beautifully rendered between these pages.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Liz Smith)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ If Frank LangellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir simply did what its title promises, it would be deep-dish gossip. But his memories of the stars heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encountered during a lengthy career on Broadway and in film shed perceptive light on the costs of pursuing and maintaining fame.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Detroit Free Press)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“LangellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncommonly eloquent book is enjoyable for the panoply of great names who turn up. . . . A natural raconteur, he seems to fit precisely Henry JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous description of the novelist as one Ã¢â‚¬Ëœon whom nothing is lost.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (New York Times)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Frank LangellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DROPPED NAMES is a different kind of memoir. . . . Not many of his peers could write such an eloquently dishy book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Los Angeles Times)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The 65 chapters in this satisfyingly scandalous memoir paint Broadway and Hollywood as teeming with vulgar, neurotic and irresistible company, and Langella as relentlessly affable in the face of nonstop groping by celebrities in far-flung locations.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Paperback Row, New York Times)\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nCaptured forever in a unique memoir, Broadway and film star Frank Langella's myriad encounters with some of the past century's most famous human beings are profoundly affecting, funny, wicked, sometimes shocking, and utterly irresistible. With sharp wit and a perceptive eye, Mr. Langella takes us with him into the private worlds and privileged lives of movie stars, presidents, royalty, literary lions, the social elite, and the greats of the Broadway stage.\n\nHow did Mr. Langella terrify a dozing Jackie Onassis? Why did he streak for Sir Laurence Olivier in an English castle? What led Elizabeth Taylor to wrap him in her pashmina scarf? Why did the Queen Mother need Mr. Langella's help? And what did Marilyn Monroe say to him that helped change the course of his life?\n\nThrough these shared experiences, we learn something, too, of Mr. Langella's personal journey from the age of fifteen to the present day. Like its authorÃ¢â‚¬â€and its subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â€Dropped Names is simply riveting and unforgettable.\n\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n\nMagnificent, Poignant\nBy AudreyLM on March 29, 2012\nI downloaded Mr. Langella's memoir on Audible so had the immense pleasure of hearing him read his own words. Growing up in NY in the 60s and 70s I was treated to a Broadway show on every birthday and adored Frank Langella in Dracula on my 17th. I was eager to learn more about him and now I have, but oh how much more I've received from this exquisite, wry, utterly revealing look at so many legendary actors, many at the sometimes tragic ends of their lives. Among my favorites are his reminiscences of Raul Julia (Two Gentlemen from Verona was another birthday treat) and Abe Hirschfeld still hard at work at age 99 (who once so kindly wrote back to me explaining that Nina was his &quot;red-haired daughter&quot; in response to my query at age 12). It brought back Sunday mornings fighting over who got to read Section Two of the Times first. Mr. Langella is honest, sometimes brutally, about these individuals and about himself, keenly insightful and ultimately deeply compassionate. This book is a brilliant historical document of New York theater in the 20th century, and much more. I had to pause often as I listened to add names to the list of people to whom I will send this book, and the list continues to grow.\n\nThe Stories of Legends\nBy Mark R. Trost on March 27, 2012\nI bought this book this morning and inhaled it in two sittings. It's a fascinating read provided by a good solid writer.\n\nI do not read autobiographies. Hell, age has taught me that history is written by gossips. And autobiographies are read through rose-colored glasses and written with hubristically hued pens. But Langella's title intrigued me. He hooked me with his preface. We experience his stories through his eyes but not from his perspective. He is the pupil - not the reader. I don't know more about Langella than I did before I read his remembrances. I've learned about his mentors. He doesn't mention them as much as he dissects them. He masterfully creates a mosaic of moving memories. His subjects are the stuffs of legends. There is a reason their names are the marques of his chapters. When I finished the book I felt entertained yet strangely saddened. Many of these names have faded and will soon be forgotten. It's good to have them set into a worthy work.\n\nLangella's bio suggests this is his foray into a career evolution. Good. The man can write. I look forward to my next read","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:389cebc34d464c5dcc745c3e9142953db8338fe3","amp;dn":"Dropped+Names+Famous+Men+and+Women+As+I+Knew+Them+%28epub%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"389cebc34d464c5dcc745c3e9142953db8338fe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,156,235,195,77,70,76,93,204,116,92,62,145,66,149,61,184,51,143,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
