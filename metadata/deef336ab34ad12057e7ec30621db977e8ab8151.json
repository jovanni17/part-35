Therefore, the membrane not only plays the role of a separator, but also takes place in the reaction itself.This text covers, in detail, the preparation and characterisation of all types of membranes used in membranes reactors.\n\nEach membrane synthesis process used by membranologists is explained by well known scientists in their specific research field.The book opens with an exhaustive review and introduction to membrane reactors, introducing the recent advances in this field. The following chapters concern the preparation of both organic and inorganic, and in both cases, a deep analysis of all the techniques used to prepare membrane are presented and discussed.\n\nA brief historical introduction for each technique is also included, followed by a complete description of the technique as well as the main results presented in the international specialized literature. In order to give to the reader a summary look to the overall work, a conclusive chapter is included for collecting all the information presented in the previous chapters.\n\nKey features:Fills a gap in the market for a scientific book describing the preparation and characterization of all the kind of membranes used in membrane reactorsDiscusses an important topic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ there is increasing emphasis on membranes in general, due to their use as energy efficient separation tools and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“greenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ chemistry opportunities they offerIncludes a review about membrane reactors, several chapters concerning the preparation organic, inorganic, dense, porous, and composite membranes and a conclusion with a comparison among the different membrane preparation techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deef336ab34ad12057e7ec30621db977e8ab8151","amp;dn":"Membranes+For+Membrane+Reactors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deef336ab34ad12057e7ec30621db977e8ab8151","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,239,51,106,179,74,209,32,87,231,236,48,98,29,185,119,232,171,129,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
