I do a lot of bootlegs.. the reason being that its just fun.. don?t get me the wrong way ? but I LOVE sampling.. i spend hours editing samples?real geeky stuff ? but I really get off on it?\n\nIf you release your tunes on a format I can sample from ? believe me ? I will fuck with it?\nI also enjoy making some tunes bigger really ? like Emerge ? I love this track ? but its too fast and electro clash for a kid dub set ? so it had to get some treatment..\n\n Other tunes like Around the World were made for two reasons because I love it so much and because I know everyone else does to ? so I made a massive build up with an extended vocal mid section to really get the feel of it and threw in some emotionally building parts followed by a dirt fest. I have to say ive never seen it disappoint a crowd ? ever.\n\n\n\n\nYou can find out more about Kid Dub, at the following locations:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/kiddub&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/kiddub&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kiddub.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kiddub.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed.\n\n\nthemagicke\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&lt;/a&gt;\n                                                         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1479eca8e8f3442b25621d384b7e8800b2eb33d0","amp;dn":"Daft+Punk+-+Around+The+World+%28Kid+Dub+Remix+2007%29+%5BUnofficial+Re","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1479eca8e8f3442b25621d384b7e8800b2eb33d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,121,236,168,232,243,68,43,37,98,29,56,75,126,136,0,178,235,51,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
