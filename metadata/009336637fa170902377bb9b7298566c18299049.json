Every shape on the map\n              tells a great story about our past. Why is California\n              bent? To cling on to gold. Why does Oklahoma have a\n              panhandle? Because of shifting borders for slavery.\n              Why does Missouri have a boot? Because of a massive\n              earthquake. This special examines how every state is a\n              puzzle piece ultimately revealing the unique\n              geography, political and social history of America.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        GREETS:\n                    - FQM - CTU - REVEiLLE - XOXO -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009336637fa170902377bb9b7298566c18299049","amp;dn":"History.Channel.How.the.States.Got.Their.Shapes.720p.HDTV.x264-D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009336637fa170902377bb9b7298566c18299049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,147,54,99,127,161,112,144,35,119,187,155,114,152,86,108,24,41,144,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
