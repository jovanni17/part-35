Frankie Darro is 17 and a veteran at this stage in comparison. Child star Billy Burrud is 10.\n\nThis film was released 21 Oct 1935, the Dead End Kids would open one week later on 28 Oct 1935 at the Belasco Theatre in Dead End.\n\nFilm is set in the Hell's Kitchen area of NYC, you will hear it mentioned several times. The review on IMDB is good, a Frank Capra-like feel good film, complete. I added an out take from They Made Me A Criminal(1939) showing May Robson slapping Johnnie Garfield relentlessly, she was a force to be reckoned with as in this movie too.\nHenry Armetta from You're Not So Tough is featured also and you will recognize the voice immediately, nice part, a really good flick.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027096/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027096/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease visit http://www.frankiedarro.com/ for more info on Frankie, the biography link is interesting/sad/complete, great web site.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:facee190b96b40b9237b60440aa247edb70d4d76","amp;dn":"Three+Kids+and+A+Queen+1935+Dead+End+Kids+%26+Little+Tough+Guys+Wi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"facee190b96b40b9237b60440aa247edb70d4d76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,206,225,144,185,107,64,185,35,123,96,68,10,162,71,237,183,13,77,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
