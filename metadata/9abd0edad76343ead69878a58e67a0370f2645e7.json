All versions of Visual Basic.Net are supported: 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 as well as all project types (Win Forms, Web, Class Library, Compact Framework, Silverlight, etc.).\n\nThere is support for the latest VB.Net language features, including VB2012 await/async support, VB2010 enhancements like Implicit Line Continuation and Multiline Lambdas, and VB2008 features such as LINQ and inline XML.\n\nKey Features\n\nSupport for the latest Visual Studio features - The latest VB.Net / C# features are supported, including Await/Async, Implicit Line Continuation, Multiline Lambdas, Nullable Optional Parameters, LINQ, XML, WPF, Lambda expressions, and extension methods.\nSupport for All Project Types - Win Forms, Web, Class Library, Compact Framework, Console, etc.\nHigh Accuracy - This release was stress tested on thousands of sample programs. Tested were hundreds of Microsoft sample projects (Visual Studio SDK samples, DirectX SDK projects, Windows 7 SDK samples, etc.), in house and customer projects, third party control samples (Infragistics, ComponentOne, Telerik, etc.), and open source projects from SourceForge and CodePlex.\nEase of Use - While the conversion logic itself is complex, using the converter isn't. You are guided through each step of the process with easy, clear instructions.\nCustomization - Not every project is the same. With dozens of conversion options to choose from, you are in control of the conversion process.\nConvert Single Projects or Groups of Projects - You can create lists of programs and convert them with one click. There's also a command line version included.\nComprehensive Reporting - There are reports showing potential trouble spots in your code, interesting things which happened during the conversion process, and any C# compiler errors which need to be fixed.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows 7/vista/xp\nAll versions: Visual Studio 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2012.\n\nHomepage: http://vbconversions.net/\n\nInstallation Instructions:[/b]\n\n- Install program.\n- Run &quot;Regme&quot; and merge it to system registry.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\n[b]Have A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9abd0edad76343ead69878a58e67a0370f2645e7","amp;dn":"VBConversions+VB.Net+to+C+Sharp+Converter+v3.03+Incl+Reg+%5BTorDig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9abd0edad76343ead69878a58e67a0370f2645e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,189,14,218,215,99,67,234,214,152,120,165,142,103,160,55,15,38,69,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
