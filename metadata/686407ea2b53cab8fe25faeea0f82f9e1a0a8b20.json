Players such as Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov have found its appeal irresistible. Many openings give Black winning chances, but the King's Indian promises Black opportunities to win games sensationally\n\nThe Main Line is White's most direct approach, and has been favored by Kasparov (when playing White), Karpov, and most of the young players vying with them for world supremacy. White tries to contain Black's tricks and squash him positionally. This conflict between space and dynamism, and between order and chaos, provides one of the key battlegrounds of modern chess.\n\nCovers all lines with Nf3 and Be2. Includes the Petrosian System, the long lines of the Classical, and many others. Emphasizes winning strategies for both Black and White. Written by two specialists, with a total of thirty years of King's Indian experience, ranging from junior tournaments to encounters with World Champions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:686407ea2b53cab8fe25faeea0f82f9e1a0a8b20","amp;dn":"The+Main+Line+King%27s+Indian+%28John+Nunn+%26amp%3B+Graham+Burgess%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"686407ea2b53cab8fe25faeea0f82f9e1a0a8b20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,100,7,234,43,83,202,184,254,37,250,238,160,248,47,158,26,10,139,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
