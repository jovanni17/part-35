But just as he finishes, the plants start disappearing. He discovers a gopher filching the little baby plants and starts battling it. They tussle for a while until Popeye gets fed up and fetches his shotgun. He chases the rodent, running past a bull and cornering it, but he doesn't have the heart to shoot. He throws away his gun, hitting the bull, who attacks. The gopher rushes to the spinach patch, eats a plant, and hurls the bull into a ravine. He teams up with Popeye to plant more spinach. \n\n\nDirector:\nSeymour Kneitel\nWriter:\nCarl Meyer (story)\nStars:\nJack Mercer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93de55328c2e90604bf51cafd9f7a9e08d212872","amp;dn":"Popeye+Gopher+Spinach+%281954%29%28avi%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93de55328c2e90604bf51cafd9f7a9e08d212872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,222,85,50,140,46,144,96,75,245,28,175,217,247,169,224,141,33,40,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
