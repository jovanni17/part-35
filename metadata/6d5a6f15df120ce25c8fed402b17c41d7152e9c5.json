But upon her release from prison, the 46-year-old decides it&amp;#039;s time to clean up her life, move back in with her family, and earn a high school diploma. Starting over as a freshman, hapless Jerri returns to class amidst a hostile student body and an unhelpful, self-involved faculty--among them sensitive art teacher Geoffrey Jellineck (Paul Dinello); ambiguously gay history teacher Charles Noblet (Stephen Colbert); and Machiavellian principal Onyx Blackman (Greg Hollimon)--while contending with a dysfunctional home life that includes her elderly father Guy (Roberto Gari), evil stepmother Sara (Deborah Rush), and bullying half-brother Derrick (Larc Spies). As ex-con Jerri maneuvers through the pecking order of teen life with zero social savoir-faire and her own brand of clueless prison ethics, STRANGERS WITH CANDY serves as a biting, politically-incorrect satire of moralizing afterschool specials and a hilarious look at the pangs of growing up--again. This collection includes all 10 episodes from the sadly-defunct series&amp;#039; second season.\n\nGenre: Comedies\n\nStarring: Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert, Paul Dinello, Gregory Hollimon, Deborah Rush\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d5a6f15df120ce25c8fed402b17c41d7152e9c5","amp;dn":"Strangers+with+Candy_Season+2+%2B+Extras+%5BXviD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d5a6f15df120ce25c8fed402b17c41d7152e9c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,90,111,21,223,18,12,226,92,143,237,64,43,23,196,29,113,82,233,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
