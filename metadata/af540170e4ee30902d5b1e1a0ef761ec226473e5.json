Its still very large (3.2) gigs and its going to take a while to get it distributed.  While I can't do anything about hit and runs, I can start posting to private trackers and I don't want to do that... so, please seed at least 1:1... \n\nKeep an eye out for a new album to be released early in 2012.\n\nDue to the size of this torrent, it would be appreciated if you everyone could seed more than 1:1... thanks.\n\n==========\n\nPennywise is a Californian punk rock band from Hermosa Beach, California, formed in 1988. The name is derived from the monster, It, from the Stephen King novel of the same title.\n\nBetween their 1991 self-titled debut and 2005s The Fuse, Pennywise had released an album every two years on Epitaph Records, a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. To date, the band has released nine full-length studio albums (the last being 2008s Reason to Believe), one live album, two EPs and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 release of their third studio album, About Time, which peaked at number ninety-six on the Billboard 200, and number fifty-five on Australias ARIA Charts. The band\\'s mainstream success was signified by a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands NOFX, Rancid, Blink-182, Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring and Sublime (unlike the last five bands, however, Pennywise refused to sign with a major label). By 2007, the band had independently sold over 3 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent punk acts of all time.\n\n==========\n\nPennywises line-up, which remained constant from 1996 to 2009, consisted of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They had kept their original line-up until bassist Jason Thirsk committed suicide in 1996, due to issues with his alcoholism, after which Bradbury joined as his replacement. In August 2009, Lindberg decided to leave the band; he was replaced in February 2010 by Ignite singer Zoli TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©glÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s. This new lineup has been working on a new album to be released in early 2012.\n\nAlbums Included:\n\nUnknown Road (1993)(Rarities, EP, Compilation)(Cue, Art, Log)\nStraight Ahead (1999) (Cue, Art, Log)\nLIVE @ The Key Club (2000) (Cue, Art, Log)\nLand of the Free (2001) (Cue, Art, Log)\nFrom the Ashes (2003) (Cue, Art, Log)\nPennywise Remaster (2005.1) (No Cue, No Art, No Log)\nUnknown Road Remaster (2005.2) (Cue, Art, Log)\nAbout Time Remaster (2005.3) (Cue, Art, Log)\nFull Circle Remaster (2005.4) (Cue, Art, Log)\nThe Fuse - Japan(with Bonus Tracks) (Cue, Art, Log)\nReason to Believe - Japan Release (2008) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\nTrack List:\n\nPennywise (1991) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tWouldnt It Be Nice\n\tRules\n\tThe Secret\n\tLiving for Today\n\tCome Out Fighting\n\tHomeless\n\tOpen Door\n\tPennywise\n\tWhos to Blame\n\tFun and Games\n\tKodiak\n\tSide One\n\tNo Reason Why\n\tBro Hymn\n\nWildcard A Word from the Wise EP (1992)\n\tFinal Chapters\n\tCovers\n\tDepression\n\tNo Way Out\n\tGone\n\tWildcard\n\tMaybes\n\tStand By Me\n\n\nUnknown Road (1993) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tUnknown Road\n\tHomesick\n\tTime to Burn\n\tIts Up to Me\n\tYou Can Demand\n\tNothing\n\tVices\n\tCity is Burning\n\tDying to Know\n\tTester\n\tTry to Confront\n\tGive and Get\n\tClear Your Head\n\nAbout Time (1995) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tPeaceful Day\n\tWaste of Time\n\tPerfect People\n\tEvery Single Day\n\tSearching\n\tNot Far Away\n\tFreebase\n\tIts What You Do With It\n\tTry\n\tSame Old Story\n\tI Wont Have It\t\n\tKilling Time\n\nFull Circle (1997) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tFight Til You Die\n\tDate With Destiny\n\tGet a Life\n\tSociety\n\tFinal Day\n\tBroken\n\tRunning Out of Time\n\tYoull Never Make It\n\tEvery Time\n\tNowhere Fast\n\tWhat If I\n\tGo Away\n\tDid You Really\n\tBro Hymn (Tribute)\n\nStraight Ahead (1999) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tGreed\n\tMy Own Country\n\tCant Believe It\n\tVictim of Reality\n\tMight Be a Dream\n\tStill Can Be Great\n\tStraight Ahead\n\tMy Own Way\n\tOne Voice\n\tAlien\n\tWatch Me as I Fall\n\tJust For You\n\tCant Take Anymore\n\tAmerican Dream\n\tNeed More\n\tNever Know\n\tBadge of Pride\n\nLIVE @ The Key Club (2000) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tIntro\n\tWouldnt It Be Nice\n\tLiving For Today\n\tFinal Chapters\n\tCant Believe It\n\tUnknown Road\n\tHomesick\n\tNo Reason Why\n\tFight Til You Die\n\tPeaceful Day\n\tSociety\n\tStraight Ahead\n\tPennywise\n\tPerfect People\n\tMinor Threat (Cover)\n\tSome Old Story\n\tAlien\n\tBro Hymn\n\nLand of the Free (2001) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tTime Marches On\n\tLand of the Free\n\tThe World\n\tFuck Authority\n\tSomething Wrong With Me\n\tEnemy\n\tMy God\n\tTwist of Fate\n\tWhos on Your Side\n\tIt\\'s Up to You\n\tSet Me Free\n\tDivine Intervention\n\tWTO\n\tAnyone Listening\n\nFrom the Ashes (2003) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tNow I Know\n\tGod Save the USA\n\tSomething to Change\n\tWaiting\n\tSalvation\n\tLook Who You Are\n\tFalling Down\n\tHoliday in the Sun\n\tThis is Only a Test\n\tPunch Drunk\n\tRise Up\n\tYesterdays\n\tChange My Mind\n\tJudgement Day\n\n\nThe Fuse (2005)(with Bonus Tracks) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tKnocked Down\n\tYell Out\n\tCompetition Song\n\tTake a Look Around\n\tCloser\n\t6th Avenue Nightmare\n\tThe Kids\n\tFox TV\n\tStand Up\n\tDying\n\tDisconnect\n\tPremeditated Murder\n\tBest I Can\n\t18 Soldiers\n\tLies\n\tMillion Miles (Hidden)\n\nReason to Believe - Japan Release (2008) (Cue, Art, Log)\n\tIntro (As Long as We Can)\n\tOne Reason\n\tFaith and Hope\n\tSomething to Live For\n\tAll We Need\n\tThe Western World\n\tWell Never Know\n\tConfusion\n\tNothing to Lose\n\tIts Not Enough to Believe\n\tYou Get the Life You Choose\n\tAffliction\n\tBrag, Exaggerate &amp; Lie\n\tDie for You\n\tNext In Line\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af540170e4ee30902d5b1e1a0ef761ec226473e5","amp;dn":"Pennywise+%28Discography+-+Sort+Of%29+%28FLAC%29+11+%2B+1+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af540170e4ee30902d5b1e1a0ef761ec226473e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,84,1,112,228,238,48,144,45,91,30,26,14,247,97,236,34,100,115,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
