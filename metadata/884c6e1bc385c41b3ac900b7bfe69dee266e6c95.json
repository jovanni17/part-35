Indeed, he once said that he got the most joy in his life from playing the violin. When he was due to receive his Nobel Prize in 1922, he was in Japan, not only meeting other physicists but also giving performancesof the Kreuzer Sonata, one of the most challenging pieces in the repertoire.\n\nMusic also played a role in his work as a physicist. He would often break off from a particularly difficult piece of work to play his violin in the hope of seeking inspiration. And he found parallels between the beauty and harmony he saw in scientific laws and the music of composers such as Mozart, which he felt reflected the inner beauty of the universe itself.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------File Information---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst broadcast: BBC R4 09 Dec 2007\nThis broadcast: BBC R4 03 Jan 2010\nType: MPEG 1.0 Layer 3 - 128 kbps mp3 - 44 khz - Stereo\nDuration: 14 minutes\nWebrip, edited with mp3DirectCut\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:884c6e1bc385c41b3ac900b7bfe69dee266e6c95","amp;dn":"Einstein%27s+Fiddle+++%28BBC+2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"884c6e1bc385c41b3ac900b7bfe69dee266e6c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,76,110,27,195,133,196,27,58,201,0,183,191,230,157,238,38,110,108,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
