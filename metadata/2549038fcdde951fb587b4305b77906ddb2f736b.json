Techno Soft released a variety of game soundtracks, some containing this music, but they\\'re insanely hard to track down and very old now.\n\nAs with my Gunstar Heroes OSV remaster, I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an \\&quot;album\\&quot; (watch out for the continuously segued \\&quot;boss medley\\&quot;).  This is some of the very best music the Sega Genesis had to offer, and seeing as a few nabbed my Gunstar Heroes torrent I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, it\\'s one of my favourite Sega Genesis soundtracks.\n\nThis collection of audio does NOT in any way duplicate the audio from Techno Soft\\'s own 1991 Elemental Master CD release with the catalog number \\&quot;TSC-0004\\&quot;.\n\n\n---------------\n\n\nTechno Soft - Thunder Force II The Soundtrack (Original Sound Version)\n\nFoobar VGM HQ WAV dumps -&gt; post-processing/mastering by Vertiphon\n\nComposed by Toshiharu Yamanishi.\nCopyright 1990 Techno Soft.\nVertiphon 2012 remaster.\n\n\n01 Great Spirit Overture (Opening Theme)  0:35\n02 Cursed Destiny (Visual Scene 1)  2:03\n03 Temptation Of The Devil (Stage Select)  1:11\n04 Dance Of Flame (Stage 1)  2:15\n05 Spirit Of Light (Visual Scene 2)  0:51\n06 Like The Wind (Stage 2)  4:34\n07 Until The End Of The Earth (Stage 3)  4:13\n08 Blood-Stained Lake (Stage 4)  3:01\n09 Terror Of The Glacier (Stage 5)  2:05\n10 Ring Of Light (Visual Scene 3)  0:57\n11 Den Of Evil (Stage 6)  1:04\n12 Shudder Of Darkness (Stage 7)  1:10\n13 Avatar Of Flame (Stage 1 Boss)  1:12\n14 Roar Of The Monster (Stage 2 Boss)  0:54\n15 Evil Beat (Stage 3 Boss)  1:13\n16 Specter Living In The Water (Stage 4 Boss)  1:06\n17 Calling On The Dark Dragon King (Stage 5 Boss)  1:22\n18 Suspicious Beauty (Stage 6 Boss)  1:05\n19 Fate (Stage 7 Boss)  1:42\n20 King Garia\\'s Revival (Final Boss)  1:54\n21 Sorrowful Requiem (Ending Theme)  1:18\n22 Ghost Story Of Hell (Continue)  0:24\n23 Setting Out (Staff Roll)  3:58\n24 Like A Nightmare (Game Over)  0:10\n\n\nThe files are in 16-bit 44.1 kHz 320 kbit/s MP3 audio format.\n\nThis soundtrack has been created with gapless play in mind.\nDo not add gaps if you burn to a CD as audio.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2549038fcdde951fb587b4305b77906ddb2f736b","amp;dn":"Techno+Soft+-+Elemental+Master+%28Vertiphon+2012+Remaster%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2549038fcdde951fb587b4305b77906ddb2f736b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,73,3,143,205,222,149,31,181,135,180,48,91,119,144,109,219,47,115,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
