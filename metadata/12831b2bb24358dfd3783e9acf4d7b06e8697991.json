In August, 1972, Wojtowicz attempted to rob a Brooklyn bank to finance his lover's sex-reassignment surgery. The attempted heist resulted in a fourteen-hour hostage situation that was broadcast on TV. Three years later, Al Pacino portrayed his unforgettable crime in Dog Day Afternoon. The film had a profound influence on Wojtowicz, and when he emerged from prison six years later, he became known as &quot;The Dog.&quot; The film examines John Wojtowicz's larger-than-life persona: he is, by turns, soldier, husband, father, lover, chauvinist, mama's boy, catholic, gay rights activist and bank robber.\n\nDirector: Allison Berg, Frank Keraudren\n\nGenre: Documentary","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12831b2bb24358dfd3783e9acf4d7b06e8697991","amp;dn":"The+Dog.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%5BHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12831b2bb24358dfd3783e9acf4d7b06e8697991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,131,27,43,178,67,88,223,211,120,62,154,207,77,123,6,232,105,121,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
