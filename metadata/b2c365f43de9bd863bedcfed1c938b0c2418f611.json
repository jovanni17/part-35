The conservatives on the Supreme Court donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to think that the Voting Rights Act is doing any good. I think the problem is with what the conservatives on the Supreme Court consider to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“good.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They certainly canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean that the Voting Rights Act doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do any good in guaranteeing voting rights for minorities, because it certainly does. They must just not think thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very good thing.\n\nDuring questioning, Justice Antonin Scalia asked if the Voting Rights Act hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become a Ã¢â‚¬Å“perpetuation of racial entitlement.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If you strip away the legal language, Scalia was asking Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do we really want black people voting?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I think Antonin Scalia is in the wrong kind of robe. He should trade in his judicial robes for something in white with a pointy top that covers the head, with eyeholes cut out. The observers in the courtroom gasped when Scalia said that. Please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do that, people. It just eggs him on.\n\nBob Woodward is saying that the White House threatened him over a piece he wrote claiming that President Obama lied about creating the sequester. Bob Woodward has had some big scoops in the past, but this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one of them. This is the kind of Ã¢â‚¬Å“big scoopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that you put into a plastic baggie and throw away at the dog park. Now Woodward says the White House Ã¢â‚¬Å“threatenedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ him in an email. What the White House aide actually wrote in the email was Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think you will regret staking out that claim.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The White House aide obviously meant the phrase to mean Ã¢â‚¬Å“you will look like a fool.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I base that belief on the fact that Bob Woodward does in fact look like a fool now. WoodwardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story is a pile of crap. How can you be sure? HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on Sean HannityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show to whine about it.\n\nIn the face of sequester budget cuts, immigration officials have released hundreds of detainees from detention centers. Or as Fox News put itÃ¢â‚¬â€Obama has unleashed his Hispanic Rape Army. Back in the real world, the detainees are being freed on supervised release while their cases continue in court. If this is a threat to anyone, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a threat to the prison contractors who make a fortune from locking these people up. The bottom line is that these people should not have been released nowÃ¢â‚¬â€they should have been released years ago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c365f43de9bd863bedcfed1c938b0c2418f611","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+February+28+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2c365f43de9bd863bedcfed1c938b0c2418f611","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,195,101,244,61,233,189,134,59,237,207,237,28,147,139,12,36,24,246,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
