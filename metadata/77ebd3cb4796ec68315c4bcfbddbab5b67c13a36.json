He has a strong voice, knows how to twist clichs to his advantage, and knows that straying too far from the clichÃƒÅ½Ã‹Å“s will lose his wide audience. In turn, that means that he\\'s enjoyable, but a little predictable, which is an accurate assessment of Live, Laugh, Love, his fifth album. The album never really distinguishes itself from its predecessors. Like those records, it\\'s a safe blend of pop ballads, mild rockers, and polished honky tonk, all delivered in  Walker\\'s twangy tenor. Even if the ballads occasionally touch on adult contemporary (witness \\&quot;Once in a Lifetime Love\\&quot;), it\\'s considerably more country than, say, Tim  McGraw, but the music doesn\\'t show enough imagination and isn\\'t organic enough to  stand apart from the neo-traditionalist pack. That said, it\\'s hardly bad -- the material may be uneven, but \\&quot;She\\'s Always Right\\&quot; has a good sense of humor and \\&quot;Lose Some Sleep Tonight\\&quot; is quite good, while the title track is an amusing twist on Faron Young\\'s \\&quot;Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young,\\&quot; a calypso-ish number that is designed for yuppies into hat music. Ultimately, Live, Laugh, Love drags a bit too much to rank  among Walker\\'s best, but it has its moments. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine \n \n \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.She\\'s always right [03:22] \n 02.Lonesome sleep tonight [03:07] \n 03.Holdin\\' her and lovin\\' you [03:24] \n 04.Cold hearted [03:59] \n 05.If A man ain\\'t thinking [03:12] \n (\\'bout his woman) \n 06.Once in A lifetime love [04:31] \n 07.It ain\\'t called heartland [03:41] \n (for nothin\\') \n 08.Woman thing [02:53] \n 09.This time love [03:53] \n 10.The chain of love [05:05] \n 11.Live, laugh, love [04:06] \n ____ \n \n 41:13 min \n 55,7 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77ebd3cb4796ec68315c4bcfbddbab5b67c13a36","amp;dn":"Clay_Walker-Live_Laugh_Love-%28Retail%29-1999-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77ebd3cb4796ec68315c4bcfbddbab5b67c13a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,235,211,203,71,150,236,104,49,92,75,207,189,219,171,91,103,193,58,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
