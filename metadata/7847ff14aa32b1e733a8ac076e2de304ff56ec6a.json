'Howdeedoodee Hiya! showcases this primitive banjo sounding instrument as well as the haunting 'Blackwater Rain' and 'I Went Down To The Riverside', a gospel paean to those grand old foes, redemption and resurrection.\nThe opening track 'No More Tears Have I Left To Cry' highlights the tug between old and new country-blues that pepper this album with It's dobro-flamenco style guitar lament. This sets the tone for the uplifting darkness that lies within and this is followed by the title track that showcases Slim's lyrical and melodic muse that is echoed by the twangy shimmer of 'When I Get Low I've Got To Get High', already a crowd favourite. \n'No Reward' and 'Junkshop Boogie' are driving romps that tail spin this album with the latter calling upon the spirit and insanity of the recently departed Captain Beefheart...ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½it's gonna boogalize yaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½!\nThe Southdowners include the harmonica blowing brilliance of West Weston who contributes to classics like 16 Tonnes and St. James Infirmary as well as many others and is backed by the solid rhythm section of Orlando Shearer (ex Otis Grand, James Hunter and Cadillac Kings) who thumps the bull-fiddle bass with Chicken Skin Schultz (ex Swamp Thing) adding drums and percussion. \nSlims motto is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmindful of the future with one foot in the pastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½-21st Century Blues. Refreshing 'For When I Lay It Down' is revivalist and reverential it is not, now how did that cotton pickin' ukulele blues go? \n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b6dfd8d0d9f6c5dadfdbdadfd1dec2d0d9d9c298d5d9db&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7847ff14aa32b1e733a8ac076e2de304ff56ec6a","amp;dn":"Slim+Lightfoot+-+For+When+I+Lay+It+Down","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7847ff14aa32b1e733a8ac076e2de304ff56ec6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,71,255,20,170,50,177,231,51,168,172,7,110,45,227,4,255,86,236,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
