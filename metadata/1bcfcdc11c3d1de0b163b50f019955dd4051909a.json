The battles and events are taken from real accounts of what happened in the year 1066. \n\n\nThis is my first torrent for all users of the piratebay. I urge you if you download then please seed. I have a maximum upload speed of only 50 kbps. \n\nThis is an excellent story and well worth watching even if your not intrested in history. The story of the characters in the film will carry you through. \n\nLong Live the pirate bay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bcfcdc11c3d1de0b163b50f019955dd4051909a","amp;dn":"1066+-The+battle+for+middle+Earth+parts+1%2B2.+%28aelfred%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bcfcdc11c3d1de0b163b50f019955dd4051909a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,207,205,193,28,61,29,224,177,99,181,15,1,153,85,221,64,81,144,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
