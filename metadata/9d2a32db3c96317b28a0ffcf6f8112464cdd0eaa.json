The series followed the adventures of Ren HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ek, a psychotic &quot;asthma-hound&quot; chihuahua, and Stimpson J. Cat, a dimwitted Manx cat.  They wander around having nonsensical adventures in a style reminiscent of the Golden Age of American animation, especially the 1940s cartoons by Bob Clampett and Tex Avery.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2a32db3c96317b28a0ffcf6f8112464cdd0eaa","amp;dn":"The+Ren+%26+Stimpy+Show+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2a32db3c96317b28a0ffcf6f8112464cdd0eaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,42,50,219,60,150,49,123,40,160,255,207,111,129,18,70,76,221,14,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
