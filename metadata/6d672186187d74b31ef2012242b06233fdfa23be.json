Similarly, each episode is presented with a foreword and afterword by the host. Unlike One Step Beyond, though, Karloff not only hosts the episodes, but appears in them as a character (except for one). A very few times, his age makes him seem slightly out of place for the role, but still -- he is the inimitable Karloff.\r\n\r\nEach episode opens and closes with Karloff in a formal, but homelike, setting. Most are before a fireplace in a castle-like hall, two are in a more modern office-like study or library. He offers a brief introduction to the story to follow, reminding the viewer that it is based on actual events, and concludes with a brief observation on what has preceded, inviting the viewer then to &quot;Please join me again for another journey into the world of the unexplainable which lies . . . behind the veil.&quot; The stories examine such phenomena as precognition, reincarnation, vengeance from beyond the grave, clairvoyance, and other supernatural staples.\r\n\r\nAside from Karloff himself, the cast differ each episode and are largely unremarkable. Two exceptions are Patrick MacNee, later known as John Steed in The Avengers (â€œVision of Crimeâ€) and a very young George Hamilton in what is possibly his first film appearance (â€œThe Return of Madame Vernoyâ€). Rather appropriately, MacNee plays a policeman, and Hamilton portrays a swarthy half-European/half Indian. In â€œWhat Ever Happened To Peggyâ€, a young girl who experiences a strange change of personality is played by Denise Alexander, who appeared in numerous TV roles (including Twilight Zone episode &quot;Third From The Sun&quot;), and achieved some fame as a regular on General Hospital for many years as Lesley Webber.\r\n\r\nSomewhat surprisingly, this series was produced by Hal Roach Studios, best known for the comedy of Laurel &amp; Hardy and The Little Rascals. At the time this series was made (1958), the studio had passed into the hands of Hal Roach, Jr. from his father and was mired in financial troubles; part of the reason this series was abandoned. \r\n\r\nWe present here a total of 12 episodes as The Veil. One, &quot;The Vestris&quot;, is NOT, strictly speaking, a part of the series. Likewise from Hal Roach Studios, it does feature Karloff and is considered the &quot;pilot&quot; episode, if one can speak of a pilot for a series which never took off. &quot;What Ever Happened To Peggy&quot; is truly a Veil episode, but was lost for many years. Many collections of The Veil include only ten episodes and omit these two. \r\n\r\nSpeaking personally, I found these two to be possibly the best, or at least my favorites. &quot;The Vestris&quot; is a nautical tale of the early 19th century, and the strange vision of a captain's wife at sea. The climactic denouement quite literally made me shiver (appropriately, as you will see!). As for &quot;Peggy&quot;, the story progresses in such a manner to point the viewer to the crux of the plot with white-knuckle anticipation without giving it away. Also, I admit I was quite infatuated with the young Denise Alexander! \r\n\r\nThe sources of these &quot;true&quot; stories are virtually untraceable; one is recognizable as a variation on a ghost story so well-known it has earned the title of &quot;urban legend&quot;. The episode &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; is the only one which might have verifiable material. It contains, in fact, none -- but it is also the only episode which was imported whole from outside, and in which Karloff does not play a character. I will refrain from any further comment on the stories as it would be far too easy to loose a &quot;spoiler&quot;, aside from assuring the viewer that these episodes are well made, the video quality very good, and perfect for watching on a dark and stormy night! \r\n\r\nAlong with these, we also offer a little Bonus Boris. Before television, there was radio, and one of radio's landmarks was a series called &quot;Suspense!&quot; Weekly episodes brought listeners &quot;tales calculated to leave you in . . . SUSPENSE!&quot; which varied from dramatic thriller to the supernatural. The radio series ran well into to the television era, and was in fact brought to the small screen in TV's early years. Although none of the radio episodes appear to feature Karloff, a few of the television episodes did. We present to you here a small sample of TV's &quot;Suspense&quot;, from 1949. Be advised that the technical quality is far less than &quot;The Veil&quot;; these were episodes performed and broadcast live, and recorded as kinescopes. \r\n\r\n1) A Night At An Inn: a tale of supernatural vengeance \r\n-from a story by Lord Dunsany\r\n2) The Black Prophet: an account of the last hours of Russian Orthodox monk Rasputin\r\n-co-starring Leslie Nielsen (Yes, I'm very serious!)\r\n\r\nAlso, two short clips, one a silent color clip of Karloff in makeup as &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot;, and a B&amp;W interview with him about &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (evidently for a Dutch program). \r\n\r\nEnjoy responsibly!\r\n\r\nThis collection is offered to you by The Penny Robinson Fan Club, now celebrating the 50th anniversary of the launch of Lost In Space!
