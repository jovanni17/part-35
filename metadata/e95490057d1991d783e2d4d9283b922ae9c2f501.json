It is used for live electronic music performance, composition and sound design.\n\nAudioMulch allows you to make music by patching together a range of sound producing and processing modules. Unlike some patcher-based programming environments, AudioMulchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modules perform high-level musical functions, so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to create things from the ground up using individual oscillators and filters. AudioMulch is designed for live performance and improvisation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you can process live audio sources and control every knob and slider on the user interface using a MIDI controller.\n\nRelease name:\nAudioMulch.v2.2.1-UNION\nAudioMulch.v2.2.1.MAC.OSX-UNION\nSize: 15MB / 22MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e95490057d1991d783e2d4d9283b922ae9c2f501","amp;dn":"AudioMulch+v2.2.1-UNION+%2B+MAC+OSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e95490057d1991d783e2d4d9283b922ae9c2f501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,84,144,5,125,25,145,215,131,226,212,217,40,59,146,42,233,194,245,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
