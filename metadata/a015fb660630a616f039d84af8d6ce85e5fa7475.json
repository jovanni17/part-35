And that argument would be relevant if Republica were attempting to work in that genre, but as their eponymous debut indicated, they had no interest in hardcore techno -- they just wanted to dance. Working with strong, accessible Hi-NRG beats and catchy choruses, the trio has a bright, energetic sound that is quite infectious when tied with the right melodies, such as on the hit singles &quot;Ready to Go&quot; and &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous.&quot; If they had more than one sound, however, Republica would be even more entertaining, but as it stands, the record is a stretch of pleasantly numbing dance-pop punctuated by two terrific singles. - Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine  \n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Ready To Go (U.S. Mix)\n[02] Bloke\n[03] Bitch\n[04] Get Off\n[05] Picture Me\n[06] Drop Dead Gorgeous\n[07] Out Of The Darkness\n[08] Wrapp\n[09] Don't You Ever\n[10] Holly\n[11] Ready To Go (Original Version)\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:48m:21s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Drop Dead Gorgeous [Live]\n[02] Bloke [Live]\n[03] Get Off [Live]\n[04] Ready To Go [Live]\n[05] Out Of The Darkness [Live]\n[06] Holly [Live]\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 00h:28m:37s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 01h:16m:59s\nTotal File Size....................... 587mb (Including FLACs, Videos, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
