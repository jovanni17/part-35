Adeline Pratt is a survivor. She is holding together what is left of her family while they are under constant siege. But as she has to face off against family members who have turned Crossed, can she bring herself to stay calm and in control? Or are the pressures of this horrific new World just too much for anyone to bare? What is the price of surviving in this new World, could it be that the only way to persevere is to be even more evil than the Crossed are? Imagine, for a moment, the worst crimes against humanity. Picture the cruelest affronts to decency. Conjure your darkest nightmares... and then realize it could all be so much worse. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Crossed (#001-135) w/Specials | (Garth Ennis):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9349616&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9349616&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Crossed (HD) (#000-009):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9449849&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9449849&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you any questions please make sure let me know on my most recent uploads ** ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b187ed9d88646a1d558c884126e628c7f771ac2c","amp;dn":"Crossed+-+Family+Values+%28HD%29+%282010%29+%28Digital%29+%28Darkness-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b187ed9d88646a1d558c884126e628c7f771ac2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,135,237,157,136,100,106,29,85,140,136,65,38,230,40,199,247,113,172,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
