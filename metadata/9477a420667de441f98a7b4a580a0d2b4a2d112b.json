The streets are empty. The phones don't work. The cars are all gone Ã¢â‚¬â€ and so are the people, at least most of them. The ones who are left are hiding and shivering in fear. They know it's only a matter of time before the clowns come and get them. Because the town of Obadiah's Glen now belongs to the clowns. And these clowns have a special secret, one that lies buried in the old cemetery on the hill... The Grave Robber's Daughter is another deliciously scary thrill ride from the author of the critically acclaimed horror graphic novel The Chuckling Whatsit (&quot;A masterpiece!&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rue Morgue Magazine) and marks the return of Judy Drood, the highly strung and short-tempered girl sleuth, last seen thwarting the murderous occult plans of a group of demented college professors in Sala's 2005 epic Mad Night. The Grave Robber's Daughter is filled with Sala's unique blend of horror and whimsy that will please his many fans and new readers alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9477a420667de441f98a7b4a580a0d2b4a2d112b","amp;dn":"Richard+Sala+-+The+Grave+Robber%27s+Daughter+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9477a420667de441f98a7b4a580a0d2b4a2d112b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,119,164,32,102,125,228,65,249,138,123,74,88,10,13,43,74,45,17,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
