Tobi is stopped by Kabuto, who asks him where he was going. Tobi replies that it was none of his concern, but tells him that he was going to Amegakure, to which Kabuto gives a devious smile after their brief conversation. Tobi arrives in Amegakure, and is immediately confronted by Konan. Tobi asks her where she has hidden Nagato's corpse and more specifically Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Rinnegan. After a brief exchange of words, Konan and Tobi begin a heated battle on Amegakure's lake. Tobi replies by saying that he will not go easy on her just because she was a former Akatsuki member. Tobi asks what is it about Naruto that made Konan and Nagato defect from Akatsuki, and Konan replies that he is light personified and carries a flower called 'hope'. Tobi tells Konan that he was the one who got Yahiko to found Akatsuki, and the one who gave Nagato the Rinnegan. Konan attacks Tobi in an attempt to kill them both. Konan recalls Yahiko, and Nagato calling each other the bridge to peace, and states that she will be the support to both their bridges. Konan asks if Tobi understands why she betrayed him. He replies no, and she says it's because he's darkness, and a flower will wilt in darkness. She reveals her ultimate technique and splits the lake beneath them in two.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6333ce7d4e4ce2b3f8400fe30f535d817e116cd","amp;dn":"%5BM%40nI%5D+Naruto+Shippuden+-+252+-+The+Angelic+Herald+of+Death.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6333ce7d4e4ce2b3f8400fe30f535d817e116cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,51,60,231,212,228,206,43,63,132,0,254,48,245,53,216,23,225,22,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
