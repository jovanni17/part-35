When Joey meets Linda English, a naive chorus girl, he has stirrings of real feelings. However, that does not stop him from romancing a wealthy, willful, and lonely widow Vera Simpson, in order to convince her to finance his dream, &quot;Chez Joey&quot;, a night club of his own. Soon Joey is involved with Vera, each using the other for his/her own somewhat selfish purposes. But Joey's feelings for Linda are growing. Ultimately, Vera jealously demands that Joey fire Linda. When Joey refuses (&quot;Nobody owns Joey but Joey&quot;), Vera closes down Chez Joey. Linda visits Vera and agrees to quit in an attempt to keep the club open. Vera then agrees to open the club, and even offers to marry Joey, but Joey rejects Vera. As Joey is leaving, Linda runs after him, offering to go wherever he is headed. After half-hearted refusals, Joey gives in and they walk away together, united.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:532497a5dd9738776c7bf333aa2e2830985416a6","amp;dn":"Pal+Joey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"532497a5dd9738776c7bf333aa2e2830985416a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,36,151,165,221,151,56,119,108,123,243,51,170,46,40,48,152,84,22,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
