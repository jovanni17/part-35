(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nA singular talent who passed almost unnoticed during his brief lifetime, Nick Drake produced several albums of chilling, somber beauty. With hindsight, these have come to be recognized as peak achievements of both the British folk-rock scene and the entire rock singer/songwriter genre. Sometimes compared to Van Morrison, Drake in fact resembled Donovan much more in his breathy vocals, strong melodies, and the acoustic-based orchestral sweep of his arrangements. His was a much darker vision than Donovan's, however, with disturbing themes of melancholy, failed romance, mortality, and depression lurking just beneath, or even well above, the surface. Ironically, Drake has achieved a far greater stature in the decades following his death, with an avid cult following that grows by the year. \n\nGenre................: Folk\nSource...............: CD {Rover Records RRCD 0001} \nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Covers, Cue, Audiochecker\nNotes:...............: Unofficial Release - Home Recordings, Demos, And Outtakes\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Strolling Down The Highway\n02.Cocaine Blues\n03.Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\n04.Betty And Dupree\n05.Get Together\n06.Here Come The Blues\n07.Come In To The Garden\n08.Summertime\n09.Joey\n10.Strange Meeting II\n11.Milk And Honey\n12.Tomorrow Is A Long Time\n13.Courting Blues\n14.Black Mountain Blues\n15.Morning Monologue\n16.Saturday Sun I\n17.Mayfair III\n18.Fly II\n19.Hazey Jane I\n20.Place To Be\n21.Parasite II\n22.Three Hours\n23.Day Is Done\n24.Time Of No Reply\n25.Three Hours\n\nCD2\n\n01.Magic\n02.The Thoughts Of Mary Jane\n03.Day Is Done\n04.Time Has Told Me\n05.Saturday Sun I\n06.River Man\n07.Joey II\n08.Saturday Sun II\n09.Saturday Sun III\n10.Mayfair I\n11.Mayfair II\n12.Fly II\n13.Parasite I\n14.Joey (Fragment)\n15.Guitar Instrumental (No. 1 - Guitar)\n16.Poor Boy\n17.Time Has Told Me\n18.Voices\n19.Sketch II - Guitar\n20.Sketch IV - Piano\n21.Sketch V - Guitar\n22.Sketch VI - Piano\n23.Sketch VII - Piano\n24.Hanging On A Star\n25.Rider On The Wheel\n26.Black Eyed Dog\n27.Tow The Line\n28.I Wish I Was A Single Girl Again\n29.Full Fathom Five\n30.With My Swag All On My Shoulder\n31.The Commissioner, He Come\n32.Dark And Devil Waters\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers..
