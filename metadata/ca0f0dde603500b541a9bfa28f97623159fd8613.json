I shall be active as often as possible but NOT 24/7.\n\nap20110601 THE BIG BROADCAST, Neil Brand.mp3\nap20110602 SBLT (Single But Living Together).mp3\nap20110603 RUMPOLE ANTISOCIAL 1-2  ON TRIAL.mp3\nap20110606 HEARING VOICES, Jimmy McAleavey.mp3\nap20110607 A MONSTROUS VITALITY, Andy Merriman.mp3\nap20110608 THE 40 YEAR TWITCH, Daniel Thurman.mp3\nap20110609 THE APPLE TREE, Gerda Stevenson.mp3\nap20110610 RUMPOLE ANTISOCIAL 2-2 GOING FOR SILK.mp3\nap20110613 BUT IF YOU TRY SOMETIMES, Sarah Daniels.mp3\nap20110614 PARK LIFE, Harvey Virdi.mp3\nap20110615 A SCATTERING, Christopher Reid.mp3\nap20110616 THE CHESS GIRLS, Lavinia Greenlaw.mp3\nap20110617 LILO,  Katie Hims.mp3\nap20110620 SUCCESS STORY, Brett Goldstein.mp3\nap20110621 A TERRIBLE BEAUTY, David Pownall.mp3\nap20110622 THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR,  Shelley Silas.mp3\nap20110623 CRIMES OF MANCUNIA, Michael Roberts.mp3\nap20110624 PLAYING FOR HIS LIFE, John Peacock.mp3\nap20110627 CAN YOU HEAR ME, Margaret Wilkinson.mp3\nap20110628 SHALL I SAY A KISS, Vanessa Rosenthal.mp3\nap20110629 A BOBBY'S JOB, Don Webb.mp3\n \nfp20110603 BULLITT, Robert L Pike .mp3\nfp20110611 THIS IS A TRUE STORY.mp3\nfp20110617 WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, Julia Hollander.mp3\nfp20110624 STONE THE TIES THAT BIND, Damian Wayling.mp3 \n  \nsp20110604 LITTLE PLATOONS, Steve Waters.mp3\nsp20110611 THE BROWNING VERSION, Terence Rattigan.mp3\nsp20110618 IN PRAISE OF LOVE, Terence Rattigan.mp3\nsp20110625 CAUSE CELEBRE, Terence Rattigan.mp3\n \nDonleavy :-)\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca0f0dde603500b541a9bfa28f97623159fd8613","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+Plays+2011-06%28Jun%29+Donleavy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca0f0dde603500b541a9bfa28f97623159fd8613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,15,13,222,96,53,0,181,65,169,191,162,143,151,98,49,89,253,134,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
