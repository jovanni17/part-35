It is said that this kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body was chopped into pieces, and his spirit was banished to the Underworld, but that he can return to the mortal realm for just one day a year: on Halloween.\n\nOf course, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just an old folktale. IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it?\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been 250 years since the last alleged sighting of Mad King ThornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spirit, and today, Halloween is safely celebrated by children (and merchants) all across Tyria.\n\nBut! Strange energies are rising under the autumn moon. Is there perhaps some truth to the old stories? Do you dare to find out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really going on?\n\nWAV 24bit\n48 kHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50bcc6496130f88a78be1c3b946471a0f702e229","amp;dn":"Guild+Wars+2+-+Halloween+2012+OST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50bcc6496130f88a78be1c3b946471a0f702e229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,188,198,73,97,48,248,138,120,190,28,59,148,100,113,160,247,2,226,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
