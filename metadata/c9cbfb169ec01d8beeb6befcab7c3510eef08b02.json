Their concerts became theatrical experiences with innovative stage design, pyrotechnics, extravagant costumes and on-stage stories. This phase was characterised by lengthy performances such as the 23 minute &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; and the 1974 concept album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot;.\nIn the late 70's and early 80's the band's musical direction changed, becoming more pop oriented and commercially accessible. \nGenesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time with approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide.\n\n- CLASSIC LINE-UP\nPeter Gabriel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, flute, percussion  (1967 - 1975)\nAnthony Phillips ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric and acoustic guitars  (1967 - 1970)\nTony Banks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano, organ, Mellotron, acoustic guitar  (1967 - 2008)\nMike Rutherford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar, acoustic guitar and bass pedals  (1967 - 2008)\nSteve Hackett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric and acoustic guitars (1971 - 1977)\nPhil Collins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums and vocals  (1971 - 1996,  2006 - 2008)\n\n- LINKS\nHomesite:        &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.genesis-music.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.genesis-music.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- AVAILABLE DISCOGRAPHY FOR THIS COMPILATION:\n1969_From Genesis To Revelation\n1971_Nursery Cryme\n1972_BBC Session 1970-1972 [bootleg]\n1972_Foxtrot\n1973_Genesis Live\n1973_Live In London [bootleg]\n1973_Selling England By The Pound\n1974_Live In Montreal [bootleg]\n1974_The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\n1975_A Blaze Of White Light_Live In Groningen [bootleg]\n1975_Live In Los Angeles [bootleg]\n1976_A Trick Of The Tail\n1977_Live In St. Louis [bootleg]\n1977_Seconds Out\n1977_Spot The Pigeon EP\n1977_Wind &amp; Wuthering\n1978_And Then There Were Three\n1978_Live In Tokyo [bootleg]\n1980_Duke\n1981_Abacab\n1982_Six Of The Best_Live In Milton Keynes [bootleg]\n1982_Three Sides Live\n1983_Genesis\n1986_Invisible Touch\n1991_We Can't Dance\n1997_Calling All Stations\n1998_Genesis Archive 1967-1975\n1998_Genesis Archive 1976-1992\n1999_Turn It On Again; The Hits\n\n- COVER IMAGES\nThe original cover art (for the single/LP or CD) is included in the Info Tag of the mp3 file\n\n- LYRICS\nLyrics are included in the torrent (PDF file)\n\n-ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nA would like to thank all the beautiful web sites from which I &quot;leeched&quot; all the information, images and lyrics.
