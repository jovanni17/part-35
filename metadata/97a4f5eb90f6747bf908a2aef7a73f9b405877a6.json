It was released as the album's first single on July 29, 2003 in the United States. It peaked at forty-two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and became a top ten hit in Australia, France and the United Kingdom, where it was Duff's debut single. The song was written by Lauren Christy, Scott Spock, Graham Edwards and Charlie Midnight and was produced by Andre Recke.\n\nThe song is included on Duff's 2005 compilation album, Most Wanted. Remixes of &quot;So Yesterday&quot; include the Thunderpuss remix and a dance remix.\n\nIn the song's music video, Duff's character plays a break-up prank on her aloof boyfriend. While he is at the beach, she steals his clothes, including an orange t-shirt that reads &quot;Everything is bigger in Texas!&quot;. She spends several days taking snapshots of strangers wearing the t-shirt and anonymously sneaking them into his mailbox. His bewilderment turns to dismay when he receives the final package returning the garment ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ along with a picture of Duff smiling, looking back, and wearing a shirt that declares, &quot;you're so yesterday&quot;.\n\nThe video was filmed primarily in and around Venice Beach and Marina del Rey, California. It was directed by Chris Applebaum and was featured on MTV's Making the Video on July 26, 2003. It debuted on the Total Request Live countdown at number nine, reaching the top spot after twenty-seven days on the countdown. The video retired from the countdown on October 8, 2003 at number two. It received airplay on MuchMusic in Canada. At one point in late August 2003 it was the most streamed music video on AOL. \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a4f5eb90f6747bf908a2aef7a73f9b405877a6","amp;dn":"Hilary+Duff+-+So+Yesterday","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a4f5eb90f6747bf908a2aef7a73f9b405877a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,164,245,235,144,246,116,123,249,8,162,174,247,167,63,155,64,88,119,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
