Which means it has some very good Thrash at it's core. Not every song is 1,000 miles per hour all the time but, each song has some very good Thrash elements in it. The (under-mixed) Bass guitar of Track 2 leads into a thundering 30 second double-bass assault.\n\n\nQuote:\nThe producer of fellow Bulgarian thrashers The Outer Limits and Mosh-pit Justice Staffa has always been fond of mixing thrash and hardcore in the best possible way and Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½At the EndÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is no exception. The progress from the previous records is obvious - the sound is heavier, the production is even better than before and the guitars are tuned to C which contribute to the overall heaviness. Unlike the previous albums, there are not many guests here, except for vocalists Shutta (Vendetta, Piranha) and Max Pain (The Revenge Project). This, however seems like a wise decision, since everything is more consistent and there are no major changes in the soloing, singing and songwriting, which was the case on StaffaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut, where a big share of guests were involved, from rock to death metal musicians. Apparently Staffa has a clearer vision now on what he wants to accomplish and this album is definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½At the EndÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers predominately mid-tempo paced thrash with a pinch of hardcore here and there. The catchy songwriting, the fitting sound and memorable choruses will enhance you listening pleasure, if you are looking for some alternative to buzzing speeding thrash metal or crossover. Lyrically it does not differ from the debut and Staffa continues to elaborate on social problems, hatred and inner struggles. The album cover is a bit strange, the creature looks like a evil idol made of mud. Not my cup of tea anyway. However, tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cancer of SocietyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Because I WantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and &quot;Cancer of Society&quot; will not leave you indifferent to StaffaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sonic aggression. Another nice touch is the cover version of Kartzer's song &quot;Virtual Reality&quot;. Kartzer was the band Staffa had the main share of songwriting and his solo albums are in the same vein, more or less. There is more to expect from this prolific guitarist as it does not take him long to release new music.\nimage\nAll in all, this is a solid piece of thrash/hardcore, definitely not a waste of time and money. And with 3 albums in 3 years, this will not be the end, as the title suggests. Staffa seems to enjoy doing what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing best and I bet it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long before the next release comes out.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n1. Last Temptation\n2. Wrong Justice\n3.
