The description, however, omits the fact that Eddie Vedder and Courtney Love both hung out there Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and that the house has been perhaps the most famous and best-loved crash pad in Boston rock and roll history. It is listed for $369,000. \n\nSince 1992, the house has belonged to Joyce Linehan, a Boston publicist (for non-profit clients including First Night, the Boston Book Festival, and the Boston Conservatory), band manager (of the Pernice Brothers), and author (of a tome compiling her tweets with Pernice BrothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ curmudgeonly leader, Joe Pernice). Linehan also has an illustrious past: she once managed bands such as the Smithereens and the Lemonheads, and for a number of years in the 1990s, when Linehan worked in promotions and A&amp;R, her Burt Street house doubled as East Coast HQ for Sub Pop Records. \n\nIt is not in dispute that HoleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Courtney Love wrote Ã¢â‚¬Å“Doll PartsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ while staying at JoyceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Love even worked JoyceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dog into the song Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but rock historians debate whether that happened at Burt Street or at JoyceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old apartment, about a mile away on Minot Street...\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n\nTalking Heads: Here come a riddle, here come a clue\nIf you were really smart, you'd know what to do when I say\nWhy am I going out of my head, whenever you're around?\nThe answer is obvious, love has come to town...\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nMight last a day yeah, hers is forever.\n\nThis being the year of the 20th Anniversary of Hole's classic album, Live Through This, what better time to get lively with vintage grapes of Hole.\n\nHole and LTT is not getting the respect it deserves. There are as yet no commemoratives  for Hole or Live Through This. There are no full live shows on audio or video commercially available.\n\n\nFor the band and the woman, when she was on it was their time to shine on, and that they did and then some. \n\nYou have not thrilled till you have thrived on the albums Live Through This and Pretty on the Inside, live and in concert.\n\n\nThe prevailing condition of the prohibition then of Love and Hole must not stand as long as I am left standing to step up to it.\n\n\n2014-12-06 around thewaymouth @ ThePirateBay\n\n\nIt was twenty years ago this Hersday this week.\n\nCourtney taught the world to play with fire, to break them all, take it all with just one song from up in Boston all night long. \n\nLive Through This live once and every now and again. Miss World - Need This - Got To Believe This.\n\n\nThere is nothing like the screams from Courtney and the girls around her at a Hole concert. Moving as all hell breaks loose all around and up inside her.\n\n\nBig beefy raw recording of the then reigning, rock's bitch at her bitchin best. My friends from my hometown roll out the rocking magic carpet ride. They show her they are hers then and from way back when, too. \n\nIn addition to many new unreleased songs, Courtney tosses back lots of unheard pieces of songs before and after many of her then current classics.\n\n\nThe music inside the old house of Orpheus just jumps. The roar is so hard yet bracing. \n\nSounds like whole world of Miss World is collapsing and exploding all at once, spinning perfectly out of complete control.\n\n\nPatty throws down her thunder bouncing it back up through the floorboards. Melissa's bass lines shake the walls in the hall. Courtney and Eric's dual-guitar attack rips across to the back and electricity fills the air.\n\n\nThe atmosphere is so charged. The crowd gets so excited. The audience sings along on the familiar songs like they are their dear own, and they cheer like they mean only everything. Courtney ups the ante with many strange wonders. She unloads a shiny new &quot;mess of mine&quot; on 'em, dropping her Best Sunday Dress. She later says &quot;I wrote this song in Boston,&quot; bringing it all back home with Doll Parts.\n\n\nCourtney sings and shouts throughout, thrilling like no business of show I know. Like she is calling upon the gods to come down and us to come on up. Like she is speaking with and for us and them both. \n\n\nShe is in her fiery element, holding court as only she can, ruling with extreme highness.\n\n\n__________________\n\n\nArtwork samples...\n\n12-04-94\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-996010-1303944296.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-996010-1303944296.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-996010-1292641359.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-996010-1292641359.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-996010-1292641273.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-996010-1292641273.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n12-02-94 + Posters art samples...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/_57.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/_57.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/_571.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/_571.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/_12.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/_12.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/103-864834NEWBU.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/103-864834NEWBU.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c942d5ef0bcd2b24b1ce572e70312d439ac09866","amp;dn":"Hole+-+1994-12-04%2C+The+Orpheum%2C+Boston+%28AUD%29+-+Rocks+Bitch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c942d5ef0bcd2b24b1ce572e70312d439ac09866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,66,213,239,11,205,43,36,177,206,87,46,112,49,45,67,154,192,152,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
