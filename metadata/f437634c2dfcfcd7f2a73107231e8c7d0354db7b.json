The victim, \nidentified as Dr. Stanley Kent, has two bullet holes in the back of his head \nfrom what looks like an execution-style shooting. LAPD detective Harry Bosch \nis called out to investigate. It is the case he has been waiting for, his first \nsince being recruited to the city\\&amp;#039;s Homicide Special Squad.\n\nAs soon as Bosch begins retracing Dr. Kent\\&amp;#039;s steps, contradictions emerge. \nWhile Kent doesn\\&amp;#039;t seem to have had ties to organized crime, he did have \naccess to dangerous radioactive substances from just about every hospital in \nLos Angeles County. What begins as a routine homicide investigation opens \nup before Bosch into something much larger and more dangerousÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½and much \nmore urgent.\n\nBreaking in a new rookie partner and chasing his first fresh case in years, \nBosch is soon in conflict not just with the LAPD brass but also with FBI \nhotshots who are convinced that the case is too important for the likes of the \nLAPD. Harry\\&amp;#039;s onetime lover Rachel Walling is among the federal agents \nfrantically working the case, making Bosch\\&amp;#039;s job all the more complicated. \nGuarding one slim advantage, he relentlessly follows his own instincts, hoping \nthey are still true enough to solve the crimeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½and to save all of Los Angeles \nfrom a deadly hazard.\n\nMasterful, taut, and pulsing with high-octane suspense, The Overlook shows \nonce more that \\&quot;among contemporary crime writers, Connelly is, quite simply, \nthe best of the best\\&quot; (Philadelphia Inquirer).\n\n----\n\nMichael Connelly originally created The Overlook as a sixteen-part serial for \nthe New York Times Magazine.
