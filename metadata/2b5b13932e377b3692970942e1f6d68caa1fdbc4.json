Leder  \nStars: Dana Andrews, Anna Palk, Philip Gilbert, Kathleen Breck, Karel Stepanek, Edward Fox  \nGenre: Horror, Trash \nRating:  0 Votes \nReview: Nazis on ice. Well, stored in the refrigerator, at any rate. The Frozen Dead formed one half of a particularly paltry pairing from Goldstar Films in the mid-sixties, with director Herbert J. Leder also responsible for It! starring Roddy McDowall. His imported fading star for this earlier picture was Dana Andrews, playing a German scientist hidden away in the English countryside, having kept a number of military personnel in cryogenic stasis since World War Two, awaiting the day when he can thaw them out in a bid to revive the glory days of the Third Reich. Unexpectedly, his young niece and her best friend turn up at his mansion (isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t that always the way, mad scientists?) and begin poking around in places they shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, resulting in the lopping-off of one unfortunate girlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s head.\n\nCheap-looking, slow moving and very, very silly, The Frozen Dead is nevertheless memorable for the frequent scenes depicting the uniformed corpse-popsicles, the horde of failed zombie experiments huddled in the basement, and the wall of severed, electronically-controlled arms (about as far removed from the poetry of CocteauÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s La Belle Et La Bete as possible, despite the visual similarities!). As for the disembodied head, shot in an eerie blue-green light and with perspex-encased pulsating brain on display, this proves to be remarkably affecting, a real testament to the performance of Kathleen Breck who manages to convey the desperation, hopelessness and tragedy of her predicament to genuine effect. Deservedly taking centre stage during the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s climax, Breck uses the power of her mind to control the adjacent row of dangling, strangling limbs before featuring in a quite stunning closing shot, mouthing the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBury meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ over and over again to the fade-out. \n \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.britishhorrorfilms.co.uk/frozendead.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.britishhorrorfilms.co.uk/frozendead.shtml&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b5b13932e377b3692970942e1f6d68caa1fdbc4","amp;dn":"The+Frozen+Dead+1966.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b5b13932e377b3692970942e1f6d68caa1fdbc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,91,19,147,46,55,123,54,146,151,9,66,225,246,214,140,170,31,219,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
