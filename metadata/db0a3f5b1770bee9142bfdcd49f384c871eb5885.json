Flash is frequently used for advertisements, games and flash animations for broadcast. More recently, it has been positioned as a tool for &quot;Rich Internet Applications&quot; (&quot;RIAs&quot;).\n\nFlash manipulates vector and raster graphics to provide animation of text, drawings, and still images. It supports bidirectional streaming of audio and video, and it can capture user input via mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera. Flash contains an object-oriented language called ActionScript and supports automation via the JavaScript Flash language (JSFL).\n\nFlash content may be displayed on various computer systems and devices, using Adobe Flash Player, which is available free of charge for common web browsers, some mobile phones, and a few other electronic devices (using Flash Lite).\n\nSome users feel that Flash enriches their web experience, while others find the extensive use of Flash animation, particularly in advertising, intrusive and annoying, giving rise to a cottage industry that specializes in blocking Flash content. Flash has also been criticized for adversely affecting the usability of web pages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db0a3f5b1770bee9142bfdcd49f384c871eb5885","amp;dn":"Adobe.Flash8.Professional.ENG.NoSETUP%5BCAMISCOOL00%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db0a3f5b1770bee9142bfdcd49f384c871eb5885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,10,63,91,23,112,190,233,20,43,253,205,73,243,132,200,113,235,88,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
