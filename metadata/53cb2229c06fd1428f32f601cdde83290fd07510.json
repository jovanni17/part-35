No Saint Out Of Me (Original Mix) (6:45 / 128 BPM)\n2. No Saint Out Of Me (Radio Edit) (3:19 / 128 BPM)\n\nThe experiments in Orjan Nilsen's studio get more and more diverse. This time, the Norwegian talent explores the harder, darker sounds inside him, coming together in 'No Saint Out Of Me'. Heavily supported by the big jocks, from Armin van Buuren to Markus Schulz, is the play thing called 'No Saint Out Of Me'. Following the bangs of 'Copperfield', 'Phireworx' and his smashing remix for ASOT600 anthem 'The Expedition', this one roars and soars and hits right in where needed. It's got the house works, the trance energy and the proggy bass, so be sure to play this out loud!\n\nPlease seed much as you can :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53cb2229c06fd1428f32f601cdde83290fd07510","amp;dn":"Orjan+Nilsen+-+No+Saint+Out+Of+Me+%28iTunes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53cb2229c06fd1428f32f601cdde83290fd07510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,203,34,41,192,111,209,66,143,50,246,1,205,222,131,41,15,208,117,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
