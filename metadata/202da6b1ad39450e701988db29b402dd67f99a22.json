A singer from another band loaned me a copy of it and The Zen of Scream 2 (NOT IN THIS TORRENT). So I'm passing it on to you guys.  The Zen of Scream 2 torrent will be uploaded soon. \n\nTorrent info: You will need winrar or like program to open it. Most DVD burning programs will burn it. I use Magic DVD copier. The RAR file will give you a full functioning DVD of disc 1 with Chapters and all the other options.  Sorry I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have disc 2 which is for female vocal training. Enjoy!\n\nThe Zen of Screaming is an instructional DVD by Melissa Cross, a vocal coach whose speciality is unclean vocal techniques used in extreme metal music styles among others. It helps singers learn how to strengthen their bodies so they can perform growled or screamed vocals. On the DVD many guest musicians, such as Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, appear to demonstrate the exercises.\n\nIn the early '90s, a passionate and unrestrained movement of singers emerged from the underground that would test the extreme limits of the human voice. Heeding the call of the warriors of rock and metal for over 15 years, Melissa Cross developed a vocal training method that has since been embraced by these artists who value raw power and passion above everything in their performance. Her groundbreaking vocal technique can enhance range and increase endurance without sacrificing intensity and individuality. \n\nCreator of the acclaimed &quot;The Zen Of Screaming&quot; instructional DVD, Melissa's clients include:\n\n3OH!3\nAirbourne\nAlexa Carter\nA Life Once Lost\nAnkla\nAnthony Green (Circa Survive)\nAmitty Affliction\nA Static Lullaby\nA Skylit Drive\nAdam Green\nAiden\nALL THAT REMAINS\nANDREW W.K.\nARCH ENEMY\nArmor for Sleep\nAshes of Your Enemy\nAS I LAY DYING\nATTACK ATTACK!\nBen Lee\nBetween The Trees\nBIFFY CLYRO\nBloodsimple\nTHE BRAVERY\nBRING ME THE HORIZON\nBULLET FOR MY VALENTINE\nCandiria\nThe Chariot\nChimaria\nCHIODOS\nCOHEED AND CAMBRIA\nCOURTNEY LOVE\nCRADLE OF FILTH\nCymbals Eat Guitars\nDaath\nThe Damned Things\nDangerous Muse\nDarkest Hour\nA DAY TO REMEMBER\nDead Poetic\nDivine Heresy\nDrop Dead Gorgeous\nEarly Man\nEmery\nEnvy on the Coast\nEVERY TIME I DIE\nEXODUS\nFrom Autumn to Ashes\nFull Blown Chaos\nGenghis Tron\nGod Forbid\nGod or Julie\nHalestorm \nH20\nHaste the Day\nIll Nino\n It Dies Today\nJustin Tracy\nKashmir\nKEVIN BACON\nKILLSWITCH ENGAGE\nLAMB OF GOD\nLeah Siegel\nMACHINE HEAD \nMADBALL\nMadina Lake\nMAROON 5 \nMatt Sweeney\nMaylene and the Sons of Disaster\nMelissa Auf der Maur\nMutiny Within\nMy American Heart\nOh, Sleeper\n#12 Looks Like You\nThe Pains of Being Pure at Heart\nParlor Mob\nPatent Pending\nPeriphery\nPush Play\nSantogold \nSAY ANYTHING\nSenses Fail\nShadows Fall\nShai Halud\nSHINEDOWN\nSICK OF IT ALL\nSILVERSTEIN\nSLAYER\nSpank Rock \nSky Eats Airplane\nSLIPKNOT\nSTONE SOUR\nTAKING BACK SUNDAY\nThe A.K.A.s\nThe Agony Scene\nThe Audition\nThe Bleeders\nThe Devil Wears Prada\nThe Graduate\nThe Showdown\n36 Crazyfists\nThrowdown\nThursday\nTommy Vext\nToo Late The Hero\nTRIVIUM\nUNDEROATH\nUnearth\nValencia\nWalls of Jericho\nYoung Love\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.melissacross.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.melissacross.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:202da6b1ad39450e701988db29b402dd67f99a22","amp;dn":"Zen+of+Scream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"202da6b1ad39450e701988db29b402dd67f99a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,45,166,177,173,57,69,14,112,25,136,219,41,180,2,221,103,249,154,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
