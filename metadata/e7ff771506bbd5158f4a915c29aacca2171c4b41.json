This LP isn't bad at all, though -- besides passable remakes of &quot;Memphis&quot; and &quot;Why,&quot; Mack attacks Frankie Ford's &quot;Roberta,&quot; Ted Taylor's &quot;Stay Away from My Baby,&quot; and Little Willie John's &quot;Let Them Talk&quot; with a slightly rockier edge than his previous stuff. R&amp;B vet Maxwell Davis did the horn charts.\n\n\n/Allmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ff771506bbd5158f4a915c29aacca2171c4b41","amp;dn":"Lonnie+Mack+-+Glad+I%27m+In+The+Band+%281969%29+MP3%40256","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ff771506bbd5158f4a915c29aacca2171c4b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,255,119,21,6,187,213,21,143,74,145,92,41,170,204,162,23,28,75,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
