Mary Ruwart credits the Tannehills and their book with winning her over to anarcho-capitalism. Doug Casey was also converted to anarcho-capitalism after reading the book at the behest of Jarret Wollstein. According to the Ludwig von Mises Institute, it was written just following a period of intense study of the writings of both Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard. It was the first significant anarcho-capitalist work to hit the libertarian movement, coming into print a year before Rothbard's Power and Market although Rothbard's book had been written earlier.&quot;\n\nFrom Wikipedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b67186ca8d99cf6ecec6e1e70fa3f50ba4c7e42","amp;dn":"The+Market+for+Liberty+by+Morris+and+Linda+Tannehil+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b67186ca8d99cf6ecec6e1e70fa3f50ba4c7e42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,103,24,108,168,217,156,246,236,236,110,30,112,250,63,80,186,76,126,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
