HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mastered a sound that seems to draw from nearly every genre and create a hip hop blend. His eclectic artistry shows a presence relative to many different classes, races and lifestyles. When asked why he pursued a career in music, he responded:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When I hear music, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m captivated note by note, sound by sound. Music is a universal language that connects people emotionally no matter how far apart or how different they are from each other. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always felt a need to connect with others, to me this is the ultimate outlet. I write about life in every facet. I love to address the important things and to just bullshit. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found that life often consists of the same things. This is about art, expression and fun. This is about leaving a legacy and etching a name. This is about music and its preservation forever and always. Its the story of life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14dfbe398e31baaddcaeb00bd0432b70756fc2d5","amp;dn":"Mason+-+Looking+Forwords+to+the+Future","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14dfbe398e31baaddcaeb00bd0432b70756fc2d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,223,190,57,142,49,186,173,220,174,176,11,208,67,43,112,117,111,194,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
