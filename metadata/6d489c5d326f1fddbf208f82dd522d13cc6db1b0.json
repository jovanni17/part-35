Volunteer\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a folk enthusiast who still hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t listened to Tigers on Trains, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just cruelly depriving yourself. One could easily argue that Grandfather and Foundry have elevated them amongst the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite, and anyone who has had the pleasure of hearing those albums probably only needs a review of Antarctica In Color as a reminder to go purchase it. Mason Maggio and Christian Van Deurs are naturally gifted indie-folk musicians, and once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard one of their works, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very little convincing thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s necessary to keep them on your radar. In pairing stunning vocal harmonies with poetically existential lyrics, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve created possibly the definitive indie-folk experience over the course of their eight year existence. Antarctica In Color is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third studio album in an already revered discography and, quite impressively, it manages to expand their sound even more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d489c5d326f1fddbf208f82dd522d13cc6db1b0","amp;dn":"Tigers+on+Trains+-+Antarctica+In+Color+%5B2014%5D+%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d489c5d326f1fddbf208f82dd522d13cc6db1b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,72,156,93,50,111,31,221,191,32,143,130,221,82,45,19,204,109,177,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
