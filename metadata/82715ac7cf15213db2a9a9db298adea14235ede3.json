Then Dirk stumbles upon an old friend behaving bizarrely, and he is drawn into a four-billion year old mystery that must be solved if the human race is to avoid immediate extinction.\n\nFeaturing a star-studded cast with Harry Enfield in the lead role, Dirk Gently&amp;#039;s Holistic Detective Agency will be produced by the same award-winning team that made the conclusion to The Hitchhiker&amp;#039;s Guide To The Galaxy. Harry is joined by Lord of the Rings actor Billy Boyd, Fawlty Towers&amp;#039; Andrew Sachs, The Golden Compass&amp;#039; Jim Carter and Peepshow&amp;#039;s Olivia Colman.\n\nConsidered by many Adams fans to be as funny as, if darker than, Hitchhikers, the Dirk Gently novels reflect Douglas&amp;#039; unique and funny take on matters as wide-ranging as consciousness, conservation, man&amp;#039;s place in the cosmos and crime. The first series features everything from quantum physics to missing cats, via Coleridge, Bach and an Electric Monk.\n\n----\n\nThis is the last of six episodes, aired by Radio 4 on Wednesday the 7th of November.\n\nThe track length is 27:50.
