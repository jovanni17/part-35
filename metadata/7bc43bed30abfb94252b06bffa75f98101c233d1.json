It was also included on the band's sixth studio album, Kick. The music was written by Andrew Farriss, who recorded a blues style demo and gave it to Michael Hutchence. The INXS singer then penned a personal love lyric, which was straight from the heart.\n\n&quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; is a sensuous ballad, layered with synthesizers and containing dramatic pauses before the instrumental breaks. Kirk Pengilly lends a cathartic saxophone solo near the end. According to the liner notes of Shine Like It Does: The Anthology (1979ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1997), the song was originally composed on piano as a bluesy number in the style of Fats Domino. Producer Chris Thomas suggested a synth-based arrangement instead.\n\nThe video for the song, featuring an extended intro, was filmed in various locations in Prague along with &quot;Guns in the Sky&quot; and &quot;New Sensation,&quot; all directed by Richard Lowenstein.\n\nThe single reached #24 in the UK, and stayed on the charts for seven weeks. In the U.S., it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAfter his death in 1997, Michael Hutchence's coffin was carried out of St. Andrews Cathedral by the remaining members of INXS and younger brother Rhett, as &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; was played in the background. This song is now thought of by many original INXS fans as Hutchence's anthem.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Tear_Us_Apart&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Tear_Us_Apart&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AACDhaaDb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AACDhaaDb&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 768x576 25.00fps 8500kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:51\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
