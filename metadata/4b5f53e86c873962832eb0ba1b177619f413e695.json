It was June 4, 1978 and he had been introduced to America with a controversial appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and two albums Rolling Stone would eventually rank among the 200 greatest of all time. Twenty-five years later, in 2003, Costello would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the following year would be ranked by Rolling Stone among its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. \nNow that historic 20-song concert will be issued for the first time in its entirety, including 11 previously unreleased recordings, on Live At Hollywood High,released January 12,2010. \n\nJust three months prior to the Hollywood High concert, This Year's Model had become his second album but first as Elvis Costello And The Attractions, with singer-songwriter-guitarist Costello joined by keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas. Producing the concert would be Nick Lowe, who would helm Costello's first five albums. \n\n\n   1. Accidents Will Happen... 3:29    \n   2. Mystery Dance... 2:02    \n   3.
