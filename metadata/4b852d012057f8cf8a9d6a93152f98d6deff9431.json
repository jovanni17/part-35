Traveling with the young duchessina from Italy to France, RenÃƒÂ© brings with him a cache of secret documents from the monastery where he was trained: recipes for exotic fraÃ‚Â­grances and potent medicinesÃ¢â‚¬â€and a formula for an alchemic process said to have the potenÃ‚Â­tial to reanimate the dead.\n\nIn France, RenÃƒÂ© becomes not only the greatest perfumer in the country, but also the most dangerous, creating deadly poisons for his Queen to use against her rivals. But while mixing herbs and essences under the light of flickering candles, RenÃƒÂ© doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t begin to imagÃ‚Â­ine the tragic and personal consequences for which his lethal potions will be responsible.\n\nParis, FranceÃ¢â‚¬â€The Present:\n\nA renowned mythologist, Jac LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢EtoileÃ¢â‚¬â€trying to recover from personal heartache by throwÃ‚Â­ing herself into her workÃ¢â‚¬â€learns of the sixteenth-century perfumer who may have been working on an elixir that would unlock the secret to immortality. She becomesobsessed with RenÃƒÂ© le FlorentinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s workÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly when she discovers the dying breaths he had collected during his lifetime.\n\nJacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts put her in the path of her estranged lover, Griffin North, a linguist who has already begun translating RenÃƒÂ© le FloÃ‚Â­rentinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mysterious formula. Together they confront an eccentric heiress in possession of a world-class art collection, a woman who has her own dark purpose for the elixir . . . for which she believes the ends will justify her deadly means.\n\nThis mesmerizing gothic tale zigzags from the violent days of Catherine de MediciÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s court to twenty-first-century France. Fiery and lush, set against deep, wild forests and dimly lit chaÃ‚Â­teaus, The Collector of Dying Breaths illuminates the true path to immortality: the legacies we leave behind.\n\n**\n\nReview\n\nSara Gruen (Lynne Harty Photography)\n\nI was fortunate enough to read a preview copy of M. J. Rose's gorgeous new novel, The Collector of Dying Breaths, and was so sad when I ran out of pages. Here, M. J. sits down with me and discusses the specific process of writing this book and answers more general questions about writing.\n\nSG: Can I just say what a joy it was to read your book, and that it was a wonderful coincidence that I did so in a 15th century villa less than an hour from Florence? How did you manage to produce such vivid descriptions of the past in your novel?\n\nMJR: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a challenge. I spend a lot of time reading art books, studying antique maps and prints, and wandering in museums looking at paintings created during the time period I write about. I also do pretty exhaustive searches looking for and then reading diaries and letters written by people during the years when the novel is set.\n\nI also have some fairly esoteric rituals. I write my first drafts in longhand with an antique fountain pen and a green ink. I used a particular kind of lined journal thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been made the same way for over 100 years. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use electric light, and if I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t write in natural light, I actually light candles and burn old incense.\n\nM.J. Rose (Pushett Irby Photography)\n\nAnd lastly, for each novel, I find a talisman from the period that I wear when writing. For Collector, it a was manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s silver and amethyst ring that I found in an antique store that in my imagination was a gift Catherine de Medici gave RenÃƒÂ© le Florentin, her perfumer and the man who created poisons for her to use on her enemies.\n\nSG: As you so passionately show, sometimes thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only a fine line between potion and poison. Were you also trying to show that there is the same kind of fine line in the emotions felt between brothers and sisters and between lovers who endure through time?\n\nMJR: I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t focused on either of those themes consciously, but it is the fine lines that are the most interesting in life, arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they? One of the amazing things I learned about perfumes and poisons is how little it can take to turn a perfume or herbal remedy into a poisonÃ¢â‚¬Â¦one extra drop of an extract or of crushed seeds can make a lovely tincture a deadly draught.\n\nI think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the same way with people. We have to be careful of how we treat each other. Our emotions swing wildly during the course of a relationshipÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the balance that we find our footing.\n\nSG: You had me guessing the whole timeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to the very end! Do you have a method for creating that kind of suspense?\n\nMJR: I wish I did because each book might be a bit easier to write. When I start a book I know the beginning of the story, and five or six beats along the way and I know the very end. But I never know how I am going to make the journey, and so as I write IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m actually challenging and surprising myself.\n\nSG: How did you become interested in writing a novel about the idea of capturing someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“dying breath?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Where did that concept come from?\n\nMJR: I was doing research on another book and learned that Thomas Edison and Henry Ford, who both believed in reincarnation, supported the idea that in death, the soul leaves the body with its last breath. EdisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dying breath, collected by his son, Charles, is in fact on display at the Edison Winter Home in Fort Myers, Florida. I was totally taken with the idea of our souls being expelled in that last breath, and it became the basis of the novel.\n\nSG: Your ability to convey the scents you write about was masterful. I truly was smelling while reading. Have you ever made perfume? Where did your interest in the subject come from?\n\nMJR: I first experimented with making perfume when I was eight years old and read about the process in a book that described mixing flower extracts with alcohol. So I took what I found around the apartment Ã¢â‚¬â€ my motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rose and lavender potpourriÃ¢â‚¬â€added some dried eucalypts leaves since I liked their scent, and then filled up the bowl with vodka (which I took from the liquor cabinet). It smelled horrific, but I fell in love with the idea of being a perfumer.\n\nAbout twenty years later, I was working in advertisingÃ¢â‚¬â€aka Mad Men land--and was assigned to a fragrance launch, from the very first days of naming it through the TV commercials we shot in Hong Kong and edited at the Lucas Ranch. It was a 40 million dollar launch that culminated with the spots running on the Oscars. During that time, I became re-intrigued and besotted with everything about the 8th art, as fragrance is called, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a passion thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never left.\n\nSG: You and I have talked about empathyÃ¢â‚¬â€œhow important do you think it is to be an empath while a writing a novel. How much more complicated does that make your life?\n\nMJR: I think being empathetic helps enormously, especially in creating full characters. A character shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be all good or all bad Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that makes him or her predictable and boring. Take the character who has just stolen a loaf of breadÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Jean Valjean is a criminal who belongs in jail until you learn he took it to feed his sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seven starving children. The minute the reader learns that and empathizes, they are emotionally engaged. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when a novel delivers and satisfies the reader (the ways yours always do).\n\nSG: SatisfactionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦yesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to do without using clichÃƒÂ©s and being predictable. But I thought you pulled off the Ã¢â‚¬Å“happily ever afterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in such a wonderful way.\n\nMJR: Coming from you, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m especially honored to hear that. I was very worried about giving my characters a HEA; most of my other novels have slightly more ambiguous endings. But these characters created their endingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦they just let me in on it so I could write it down.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Gripping--a suspenseful and enigmatic story...
