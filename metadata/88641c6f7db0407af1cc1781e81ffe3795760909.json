Players assume the role of four new survivors, each with their own personality and new dialog. The game leads them through the southeastern region of the US -- from Savannah, Georgia through the bayou country, and climaxing in New Orleans' French Quarter.\n\nThis co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities, swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South, from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns. You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan. You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new &quot;uncommon&quot; common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nOperating System: Microsoft Windows XP (SP3) / Windows Vista (SP1) / Windows 7\nProcessor: Intel Core Duo E6600/AMD Phenom X3 8750 or better;\nRAM: 2 GB (2 GB for Vista / 7)\nHard drive space: 14 GB of free disk space\nSound: compatible with DirectX\nVideo: NVIDIA GeForce 8600GT/ATI Radeon X1950 Pro or better with 256 MB\n\nRepacked by: R.G.
