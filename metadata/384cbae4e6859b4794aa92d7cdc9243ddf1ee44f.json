It was one of his last concerts before he passed away 5 months later. Joined by longtime band-mates Tyree Glenn and Tommy Gwaltney, Armstrong shows no signs of frailty while singing, and to everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprise, playing trumpet on classics including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mack the KnifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rocking Chair.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The recording was originally a limited vinyl release by the National Press Club in 1972. Armstrong often signed letters Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red Beans and Rice-ly Yours,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which makes for an apt title for the recording especially since his favorite recipesÃ¢â‚¬â€everything from Louisiana Caviar to the SazeracÃ¢â‚¬â€are included in the liner notes, as they were in the original pressing. 11 tracks, 58 minutes.\n\nThis recording was produced in collaboration with The National Press Club and The Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation.\n\n\nYEAR OF RECORDING 1972\nRECORD LABEL Smithsonian Folkways Special Series\nSOURCE ARCHIVE Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage\nCREDITS Produced by Kim Gregory ; Liner Notes by Ralph de Toledano ; Liner Notes by Christopher Blake ; Design by Stan Jennings ; Produced in collaboration with The National Press Club ; Produced in collaboration with Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation\n\nSatchmo at the National Press Club: Red Beans and Rice-ly YoursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\n11 tracks, 58 minutes:\n\n1971 Press Club Concert featuring Louis Armstrong\n\n1.
