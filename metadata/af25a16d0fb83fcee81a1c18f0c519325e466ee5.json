He has also released two singles, &quot;Club Thing&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Lie&quot;, the former having some success and charting in countries around Europe. His song &quot;Adore Adore&quot; was also featured in &quot;Redwood&quot;, an episode of The Mentalist.\n\nSince YoavÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s critically acclaimed debut album, Charmed and Strange (2008) he has been on a journey of sold-out headline shows in Canada, the U.S., and Europe.
