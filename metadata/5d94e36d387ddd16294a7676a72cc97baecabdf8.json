The world map is linear with the controlled character's movements, \n\nwhich is then limited to dotted lines from place to place. The field map is used \n\nwhenever the player enters a town, dungeon, or landmark. It consists of HD graphics, \n\ncharacters and backgrounds. Animations are overlaid to create motion such as the \n\nmovement of water or light effects. Battle mode is a 3D field that complements the \n\ncurrent field map. Turn-based battles occur in this between playable characters and \n\nCPU-controlled enemies. Standard actions such as attack, magic, defend, item and \n\nescape are present and implemented in various ways.\n\n\ninstallation instructions: copy destination folder to PSPGAME\n\n\nseed please","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d94e36d387ddd16294a7676a72cc97baecabdf8","amp;dn":"Legend+of+Dragoon+PSP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d94e36d387ddd16294a7676a72cc97baecabdf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,148,227,109,56,125,221,22,41,74,118,118,167,44,201,123,174,202,189,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
