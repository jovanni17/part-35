This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Have any former school-teachers ever hit the top 40?&quot;\n\nThis countdown has eight debut songs and aired on the same day MTV was launched.\n\nThere is a band in the countdown where all its memebers live Tuskegee, Alabama, and each lives on a strret named after him.\n\nAs of this week in 1981, only two countries ever had one act follow another into the number one spot: England and Canada. This countdown adds Australia to the list.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What song has spent the most weeks in the top 40 in the rock era?&quot; (It's a four way tie, each song spending half a year on the chart!)\n\nJohn Schneider (&quot;Bo Duke&quot; of The Dukes Of Hazzard) has a song in the countdown.\n\n40 YOUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢RE MY GIRL Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Franke &amp; The Knockouts\n39 REALLY WANNA KNOW YOU Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gary Wright\n38 STOP DRAGGINÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ MY HEART AROUND Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stevie Nicks w/Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers\n37 DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T WANT TO WAIT ANYMORE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Tubes\n36 LOVE ON A TWO WAY STREET Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stacy Lattisaw\n35 FEELS SO RIGHT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alabama\n34 DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T GIVE IT UP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Robbie Patton\n33 ROCK &amp; ROLL DREAMS COME THROUGH Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jim Steinman\nLDD: WHILE YOU SEE A CHANCE - Steve Winwood\n32 DOUBLE DUTCH BUS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Frankie Smith\nARCHIVES: WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL - The New Vaudeville Band\n31 FIRE AND ICE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pat Benatar\n30 WHOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S CRYING NOW Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Journey\n29 A WOMAN NEEDS LOVE (JUST LIKE YOU DO) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ray Parker, Jr. &amp; Raydio\n28 COOL LOVE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pablo Cruise\n27 THE BREAKUP SONG (THEY DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T WRITE Ã¢â‚¬ËœEM) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Greg Kihn Band\n26 MODERN GIRL Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sheena Easton\n25 MEDLEY Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stars on 45\n24 DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T LET HIM GO Ã¢â‚¬â€œ REO Speedwagon\n23 IN THE AIR TONIGHT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Phil Collins\n22 URGENT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Foreigner\nARCHIVES: GOOD VIBRATIONS - The Beach Boys\n21 ALL THOSE YEARS AGO Ã¢â‚¬â€œ George Harrison\n20 ITÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S NOW OR NEVER Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Schneider\n19 SWEET BABY Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stanley Clarke &amp; George Duke\n18 THE STROKE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billy Squier\n17 LADY (YOU BRING ME UP) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Commodores\n16 TOUCH ME WHEN WEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢RE DANCING Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Carpenters\n15 TIME Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Alan Parsons Project\n14 ENDLESS LOVE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Diana Ross &amp; Lionel Richie\n13 NO GETTINÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ OVER ME Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ronnie Milsap\n12 GEMINI DREAM Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Moody Blues\nARCHIVES: I'M A BELIEVER - The Monkees\n11 YOU MAKE MY DREAMS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n10 QUEEN OF HEARTS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Juice Newton\n9 HEARTS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Marty Balin\nLDD: LOVE YOU LIKE I NEVER LOVED BEFORE - John O'Banion\n8 BOY FROM NEW YORK CITY Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Manhattan Transfer\n7 BETTE DAVIS EYES Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kim Carnes\n6 SLOW HAND Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Pointer Sisters\n5 ELVIRA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Oak Ridge Boys\n4 I DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T NEED YOU Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Rogers\n3 BELIEVE IT OR NOT (THEME FROM GREATEST AMERICAN HERO) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joey Scarbury\n2 THE ONE THAT YOU LOVE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Air Supply\n1 JESSIEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S GIRL Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rick Springfield\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88b19ca880bfa5f2b60175cbc25fb21502757ca","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1981_August_1st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88b19ca880bfa5f2b60175cbc25fb21502757ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,139,25,202,136,11,250,95,43,96,23,92,188,37,251,33,80,39,87,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
