They belong to a boy, a boy who has not seemed remarkable until now. And Helen--terrified, but intrigued--is drawn to him. The fact that he is in a body and she is not presents this unlikely couple with their first challenge. But as the lovers struggle to find a way to be together, they begin to discover the secrets of their former lives and of the young people they come to possess.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91f281b66dc26a867e70c4b03bfcbacc78e645f6","amp;dn":"A+Certain+Slant+of+Light+-+Laura+Whitcomb.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91f281b66dc26a867e70c4b03bfcbacc78e645f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,242,129,182,109,194,106,134,126,112,196,176,59,252,186,204,120,230,69,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
