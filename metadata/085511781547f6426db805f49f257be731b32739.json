For this album, Athlete demonstrate a more mature musical style, creating a more stripped-down, sombre and reflective album than their first album Vehicles &amp; Animals.\nThe first single from the album, &quot;Wires&quot;, became the biggest hit so far for the band when it entered the UK Singles Chart at #4. The album also fared well in the charts, reaching the top of the UK Albums Chart the week it was released, selling 89,000 copies. Despite this success, Tourist had a mixed critical reception, with some suggesting that Athlete had failed to sustain the unique style of their previous album, while others saw the new album as a logical progression from their old sound. Despite the mainstream breakthrough the band achieved with this album, their fanbase was reduced to a mere cult when follow-up Beyond the Neighbourhood became their smallest-seller.\nAt the end of 2005, Tourist became the 32nd best-selling album of the year in the UK, and &quot;Wires&quot; was the 89th best-selling single.\n\n1.\t&quot;Chances&quot;  \t4:50\n2.\t&quot;Half Light&quot;  \t3:41\n3.\t&quot;Tourist&quot;  \t3:57\n4.\t&quot;Trading Air&quot;  \t4:27\n5.\t&quot;Wires&quot;  \t4:20\n6.\t&quot;If I Found Out&quot;  \t5:02\n7.\t&quot;Yesterday Threw Everything at Me&quot;  \t3:45\n8.\t&quot;Street Map&quot;  \t4:38\n9.\t&quot;Modern Mafia&quot;  \t2:45\n10.\t&quot;Twenty Four Hours&quot;  \t5:01\n11.\t&quot;I Love&quot;  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:085511781547f6426db805f49f257be731b32739","amp;dn":"Athlete+-+Tourist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"085511781547f6426db805f49f257be731b32739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,85,17,120,21,71,246,66,109,184,5,244,159,37,123,231,49,179,39,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
