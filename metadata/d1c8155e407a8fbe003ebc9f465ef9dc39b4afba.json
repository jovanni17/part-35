Tony is an acknowledged master and internationally beloved Hammond jazz organist. Howard is a noted recording artist, lecturer, and most prominently known as President/CEO of Benedetto Guitars, Inc., one of the world's premier jazz guitar makers. They are joined by Jim Rupp, who's years of road work and recording with the bands of Wood Herman, Maynard Ferguson, Glenn Miller and Diane Schuur made him a most dynamic and swinging drummer. This is a O.G.D. trio with an authenticity rarely seen in the genre today.\n\n--------\n\nIf you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows).
