The album hit\n#1 on the Billboard album charts in the fall of 1974 and spun off successful singles with\n&quot;Jazzman&quot; (#2 pop) and &quot;Nightingale&quot; (#9 pop as well as #1 adult contemporary).\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn 1974, while Carly and Joni were battling it out for top honors amidst the proliferation of\nfemale singer-songwriters at the time, Carole King released &quot;Wrap Around Joy&quot;, a mostly\njoyful pop-rock entry into the fold, showing that she was still one of the mighty queens of the\nrock world.\n\nOf course her endeavor was tremendously aided by the huge hit single, &quot;Jazzman&quot;, with Tom\nScott's memorable sax performance; but &quot;Wrap Around Joy&quot; has many other noteworthy\nsongs.\n\nCarole's power piano chords of the sing-along opening cut &quot;Nightingale&quot; (a second top ten hit\nfor her from this album) really capture the listener's attention right from the get-go. &quot;My Lovin'\nEyes&quot; and &quot;You Gentle Me&quot; are wonderful pop-rock confections, as is the title track and\n&quot;You're Something New&quot;, one of my favorite Carole King start-of-love songs ever.\nConversely, &quot;You Go You're Way, I'll Go Mine&quot; is one of the best break-up songs I've ever\nknown.\n\n&quot;We Are All In This Together&quot; is a great song of unification of the human race and is,\ntherefore, quite an IMPORTANT message still today in this mad, mad, mad, mad world in\nwhich we live. I love the optimism of this song especially when balanced with the closing\nsong, &quot;The Best Is Yet To Come&quot;, which never fails to lift my spirit. Songs like these make me\nvery grateful to Carole King for the solace her music has given my life on so many occasions.\nListen and see if you don't know what I mean. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Palmer_%28vocalist%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Palmer_%28vocalist%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAll tracks composed by Carole King, lyrics by Dave Palmer.\n\n  01. &quot;Nightingale&quot; ~ 3:38\n  02. &quot;Change of Mind, Change of Heart&quot; ~ 4:39\n  03. &quot;Jazzman&quot; ~ 3:44\n  04. &quot;You Go Your Way, I'll Go Mine&quot; ~ 3:34\n  05. &quot;You're Something New&quot; ~ 2:55\n  06. &quot;We Are All in This Together&quot; ~ 4:03\n  07. &quot;Wrap Around Joy&quot; ~ 2:59\n  08. &quot;You Gentle Me&quot; ~ 3:46\n  09. &quot;My Lovin' Eyes&quot; ~ 3:08\n  10. &quot;Sweet Adonis&quot; ~ 3:22\n  11. &quot;A Night This Side of Dying&quot; ~ 2:59\n  12. &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot; ~ 3:30\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:42:21\nTotal Size...........: 253.47 MB\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nCarole King ~ synthesizer, guitar, piano, vocals\nTom Scott ~ saxophone\nSusan Ranney ~ bass\nLouise Goffin ~ background vocals\nMike Altschul ~ horn\nGeorge Bohannon ~ trombone\nMari Tsumura ~ violin\nDenyse Buffum ~ viola\nThomas Buffum ~ violin\nDavid Campbell ~ viola\nGene Coe ~ horn\nMaurice Dicterow ~ violin\nRichard Feves ~ bass\nChuck Findley ~ trumpet\nFrederick Seykora ~ cello\nSherry Goffin ~ background vocals\nAbigale Haness ~ background vocals\nJim Horn ~ saxophone\nRichard Hyde ~ trombone\nDanny &quot;Kootch&quot; Kortchmar ~ guitar, vocals\nCharles Larkey ~ bass\nGordon Marron Strings ~ violin\nDan Neufeld ~ viola\nAndy Newmark ~ drums\nDean Parks ~ guitar\nPaul Polivinick ~ viola\nJay Rosen ~ violin\nSheldon Sanov ~ violin\nHaim Shtrum ~ violin\nJeff Solow ~ cello\nLya Stern ~ violin\nPolly Sweeney ~ violin\nErnie Watts ~ horn\nDick Hyde ~ horn\nRichard Kaufman ~ violin\nNina Deveritch ~ cello\nBobby Dubow ~ violin\nGottfried Hoogeveen ~ cello\nDan Newfeld ~ viola\nFred Jackson, Jr. ~ horn\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9b5fb4506f17bf7a830db1abdab603a088e5af","amp;dn":"Carole+King+-+Wrap+Around+Joy+1974+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9b5fb4506f17bf7a830db1abdab603a088e5af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,155,95,180,80,111,23,191,122,131,13,177,171,218,182,3,160,136,229,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
