Contractual reasons may have prevented the CD's release under Barron's name and like many Venus dates, this is not a working trio, but one assembled for the record date. As one of the busiest pianists around, Barron has a wealth of music at his fingertips and he doesn't disappoint with fresh approaches to standards and jazz compositions that make up this session. Leonhart occasionally shows a sense of humor in his solos, while Foster is a capable drummer who has worked with many stars, in addition to occasionally recording as a leader. The driving &quot;All of Me&quot; is a nice switch from the typical relaxed arrangement, while the Latin-flavored take of Bud Powell's &quot;Cleopatra's Dream&quot; swings. Barron's scoring of &quot;Misty&quot; proves lyrical and spacious, while he personalizes Duke Ellington's rarely performed &quot;Sunset and the Mockingbird&quot; with his distinctive touch. It is difficult not to think of Art Tatum when one sees &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot; followed by &quot;Yesterdays,&quot; but Tatum was not on Barron's mind for these performances. The former is a showcase for Leonhart's masterful arco playing, with the latter being a bouncy post-bop rendition of this old chestnut.
