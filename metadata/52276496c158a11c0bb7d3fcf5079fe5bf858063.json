It always felt to me like a fragment of a live album, not a whole album. What I've done here is to take the audio from the DVD of 9012 Live and add the solo pieces from the CD into it. The DVD (and the redundant portions of the CD) were recorded at Northlands Coliseum, Edmonton, Canada on September 28, 1984, and the solo pieces were recorded at Dortmund, Germany on June 24, 1984. The solos added to the sequencing makes for a less commercial show that begins to recapture some of Yes' prog rock roots. Conversely, adding the concert to the solos makes it seem like a full live album now instead of a highlights collection.\n\n01 Intro\n02 Cinema\n03 Leave It\n04 Hold On\n05 I've Seen All Good People\n06 Si\n07 Solly's Beard\n08 Changes\n09 Owner of a Lonely Heart\n10 It Can Happen\n11 Amazing Grace\n12 Whitefish\n13 City of Love\n14 Starship Trooper\n15 Soon\n16 Roundabout\n\nMore to come.
