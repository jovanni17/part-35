Journeying round the oceans, he explores life's first laboratory and discovers how the incredible variety of sea creatures arose, from the first microbes to hagfish and dolphins.\n\nToday, there are few places on Earth devoid of life. But long ago, this was a barren planet. Watch as the latest integrated graphic techniques reveal the amazing evolutionary processes that gave rise to all manner of adaptations legs, wings, eyes and more and allowed life to progress from its single-cell origins to domination of the entire planet.\n\nIf you're looking for traces of the origin of life on Earth, head to the source the ocean, where life percolated for over 3 billion years.
