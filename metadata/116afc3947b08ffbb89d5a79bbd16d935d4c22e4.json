His flatmate Naz is an intrepid eccentric: in his own mind, a polymath of unparalleled genius. In reality, heâ€™s an idiot.\r\nTogether, these two manchildren present their life in the flat as a fun-packed TV schedule, with each farcical incident playing out in the form of well known shows.\r\n\r\nIn Iâ€™m Not a Celebrity ... Get Me Back In My Flat!, Naz must root through a dumpster full of bin juice to find his missing keys. In the Big Flat Diary Room, Tom and Naz tear strips off each other as they fight over the flatâ€™s feng shui. And in an exclusive interview for Flat News, Naz proudly presents his Dragonâ€™s Deninvention â€“ the Swiss Army Hat, which is basically just a cap with cutlery fastened to it.\r\nEach episode sees many more hit programmes sent up, as Tom and Naz blunder their way from one domestic mishap to the next. These are relatable stories of everyday existence, brilliantly reimagined as popular entertainment formats. A fresh and distinctive comedy for the next generation, Flat TV is the classic sitcom as youâ€™ve never seen it before.\r\n\r\nBBC (2014) - 4 Episodes (20mins each)\r\n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03m5b2j\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\n832x468 resolution\r\n\r\nVideo Codec h.264\r\nAudio Codec AAC\r\n\r\nWith subtitles - enjoy !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:116afc3947b08ffbb89d5a79bbd16d935d4c22e4","amp;dn":"Flat.TV--BBC-2014-w.subs-468p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"116afc3947b08ffbb89d5a79bbd16d935d4c22e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,106,252,57,71,176,143,251,184,157,90,121,187,209,109,147,93,76,34,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
