This is a full install and Feelthere/Wilco directs that the original be uninstalled before applying this &quot;update.&quot; Many small errors were fixed and this version includes a &quot;yokeless&quot; VC.\nhttp://www.wilcopub.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=prod_erjv2\n\nEnjoy, be patient and if anyone has the B767 by CaptainSim or CLS to share here I would be really stoked. Also available is the CLS Piper Arrow and the new PMDG 747x, so expect those soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d4db6b059e4e2080424f336eb31a2506ebcbf80","amp;dn":"FSX+Embraer_Regional_Jet_SP1.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d4db6b059e4e2080424f336eb31a2506ebcbf80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,77,182,176,89,228,226,8,4,36,243,54,235,49,162,80,110,188,191,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
