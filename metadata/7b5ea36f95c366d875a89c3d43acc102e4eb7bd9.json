When encountering an enemy, the Punisher can attack, or sneak up to perform a one-button &quot;quick kill&quot;. Depending on the villain, the current location, and a player-determined level of aggression, one of numerous fatal assaults will be performed. The game's environments also feature interrogation &quot;hot spots&quot;, where the vigilante can essentially torture his enemies, coercing them to share information that may help him in his quest.\n\nThe game features many cameo appearances from Marvel Comics characters, such as Iron Man, Nick Fury, Black Widow, Matt Murdock (the alter ego of Daredevil), Bushwacker, The Kingpin and Bullseye. Also present are several characters from the Welcome Back, Frank storyline, such as detectives Martin Soap and Molly Van Richtofen, the Punisher's neighbors Joan and Spacker Dave, Ma Gnucci, The Russian and General Kreigkopf.\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\nSystem:\n    AMD 1 GHz or Pentium III 1 GHz or equivalent\nRAM:\n    128 MB\nVideo Memory:\n    64 MB\nHard Drive Space:\n    2000 MB\nOther:\n    100% DirectX 8 compatible sound card\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b5ea36f95c366d875a89c3d43acc102e4eb7bd9","amp;dn":"The+Punisher+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b5ea36f95c366d875a89c3d43acc102e4eb7bd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,94,163,111,149,195,102,216,117,168,156,61,67,172,193,2,228,235,123,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
