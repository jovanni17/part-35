The line is also \n\npopular with enthusiasts and rail fans due to its resident roster of GWR and \n\nS and DJR locomotives, and regular visiting locomotives on rail tours or for galas. \n\nStarting out on the sea front at Minehead, the line heads south east along the \n\ncoast to Dunster and Watchet, before heading inland to Williton where the oldest \n\nsignal box on the line stands. Climbing out of Williton along the side of the \n\nQuantock Hills Ã¢â‚¬â€œ where passengers are afforded stunning views across the Somerset \n\ncountryside Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the line reaches its summit at Crowcombe Heathfield before \n\ndescending down the steep 1 in 81 decline to Bishops Lydeard. \n\nIncluded with the route are three of the railwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular locomotives - \n\nClass 7F No. 88 in Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway livery, GWR Hall Class \n\nRaveningham Hall and BR Green Class 33 D6575. Accompanying these locomotives \n\nare appropriate BR Mk1 coaching stock and GWR/BR freight wagons.\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nPlease use the email address or the facebook fanpage for requests, questions and \n\nalso if you want to share an addon with the community which we will post on your \n\nbehalf.\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please read the Readme.pdf.\n\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bcc8d9ddd1c8ccde88d9cad9cefcdbd1ddd5d092dfd3d1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nA Team tpb_4_ever upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb31a1f006d80095f1337eefe0f9ed725a0cc50f","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+West+Somerset+Railway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb31a1f006d80095f1337eefe0f9ed725a0cc50f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,49,161,240,6,216,0,149,241,51,126,239,224,249,237,114,90,12,197,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
