The word \n\nspreads quickly through the city: the party is on. Saturday evening, two \n\nhundred people secretly converge at an abandoned San Francisco warehouse. \n\nAs the sun sets the records start spinning, setting into motion a night \n\nthat no one will forget. Meet David Turner, a Midwest transplant. He \n\nmoved to the city with aspirations of starting his career as a writer but \n\nhis hopes have stalled. After four years he finds himself writing \n\ninstruction manuals for a computer company. Overworked and with little \n\nsocial life, David spends his time alone, his dream of being a novelist a \n\ndistant memory. That night, his brother Colin Turner invites him to \n\nGROOVE. Colin has a surprise for his new girlfriend, young raver sprite \n\nHarmony Stitts, and he wants David there. David reluctantly agrees and is \n\nshocked when Colin proposes to Harmony at the party. In the ensuing \n\ncelebration, they take Ecstasy and suddenly, David is thrust into the \n\nworld of the San Francisco underground. In a chance encounter, David \n\nmeets longtime New York raver Leyla Heydel and makes an unlikely \n\nconnection. Through their budding relationship, they&amp;#039;re reminded of a \n\nsense of possibility and freedom in their lives they had all but \n\nforgotten. But as the party rages on, Colin reveals a deep secret, one \n\nthat threatens to destroy his relationship with Harmony. When the sun \n\nrises the party disappears, and the chaos of the last twelve hours \n\nchanges the two brothers forever.\n\n\n\nYear: 2000\nDuration: 1:23\nCompression: Full DVD (no compression)\nVideo: MPEG-2 720x480 NTSC (Widescreen - TV mode adjustable on the DVD menu)\nAudio: English (Dolby AC-3, 2-6 Channels, 48Khz)\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, PortuguÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, Chinese, Korean, Thai\n\n\nEnjoy ^^\n\nPS: Please seed ;D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8308a1331b20dc854cd549c056c046290f562f02","amp;dn":"Groove+-+Mundo+Rave+%282000%29+Full+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8308a1331b20dc854cd549c056c046290f562f02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,8,161,51,27,32,220,133,76,213,73,192,86,192,70,41,15,86,47,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
