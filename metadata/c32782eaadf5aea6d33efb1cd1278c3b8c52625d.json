Bruce couldn't believe he was being continuously arrested for his words. He wanted to use these tapes as proof to the judge and jury that he was not obscene, but that his bits were simply being taken out of context. Bruce chose to ignore the irony that these same tapes contained many of the bits that got him arrested in the first place. To Is a Preposition, Come Is a Verb is not only an early representation of the type of humor that would open the door for Richard Pryor, Sam Kinison, George Carlin, and many others, but more importantly provides a dangerous glimpse into the world of censorship and where it can lead. The fact that Lenny Bruce, whose morality is evident on these tapes, could have been arrested numerous times because of what he said to an audience paying to hear his words, then endlessly harassed by the police because of it, remains a travesty. The proof is included here.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/to-is-a-preposition-come-is-a-verb-mw0000617142&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/to-is-a-preposition-come-is-a-verb-mw0000617142&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNotes\nRecordings from Lenny Bruce's private tape stash.\nChanneled for quality performance on stereo equipment.\nDistributed by Pip Records A division of Pickwick International, Inc.\nDouglas Inner sleeve w/grey &amp; violet graphics\nTracks A2, B2, B4 are edits from the Jazz Workshop show on 4.10.61\nThe rest is probably from 1962/63\nKnitting Factory CD re-issue (2000)\n\n01 - To Come\n02 - I Just Do It and That's All\n03 - Hubert's Museum\n04 - The Perverse Act\n05 - Tits and Ass\n06 - Completely Exposed\n07 - A Pretty Bizarre Show\n08 - Blah Blah Blah\n09 - Dirty Toilet\n10 - Would You Sell Out Your Country\n11 - A White White Woman and Black Black Woman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32782eaadf5aea6d33efb1cd1278c3b8c52625d","amp;dn":"Lenny+Bruce+-+To+is+a+Preposition%3B+Come+is+a+Verb+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32782eaadf5aea6d33efb1cd1278c3b8c52625d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,39,130,234,173,245,174,166,211,62,251,28,209,39,140,59,140,82,98,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
