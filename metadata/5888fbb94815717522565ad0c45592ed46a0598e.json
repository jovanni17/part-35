BUZZ BOOK 2013. An Amazon Best Book of the Month. A Junior Library Guild Selection. A Kids Indie Next List #4 on Top Ten Autumn 2013\n\n\nIn the tradition of Out of My Mind, Wonder, and Mockingbird, this is an intensely moving middle grade novel about being an outsider, coping with loss, and discovering the true meaning of family.\n\nWillow Chance is a twelve-year-old genius, obsessed with nature and diagnosing medical conditions, who finds it comforting to count by 7s. It has never been easy for her to connect with anyone other than her adoptive parents, but that hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kept her from leading a quietly happy life . . . until now.\n \nSuddenly WillowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world is tragically changed when her parents both die in a car crash, leaving her alone in a baffling world. The triumph of this book is that it is not a tragedy. This extraordinarily odd, but extraordinarily endearing, girl manages to push through her grief. Her journey to find a fascinatingly diverse and fully believable surrogate family is a joy and a revelation to read.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5888fbb94815717522565ad0c45592ed46a0598e","amp;dn":"Counting+by+7s+-+Holly+Goldberg+Sloan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5888fbb94815717522565ad0c45592ed46a0598e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,136,251,185,72,21,113,117,34,86,90,208,196,85,146,237,70,160,89,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
