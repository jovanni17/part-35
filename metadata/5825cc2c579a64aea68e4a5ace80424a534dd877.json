Malsch (CRC, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0824725794\r\n\r\nBiomedical nanotechnology is one of the fastest-growing fields of research across the globe. However, even the most promising technologies may never realize their full potential if public and political opinions are galvanized against them, a situation clearly evident in such controversial fields as cloning and stem cell research. Biomedical Nanotechnology presents state-of-the-art research in the field and also considers the socio-political risks and perceptions of this important science.\r\n\r\nContributed by prominent experts in this expansive and interdisciplinary field, Biomedical Nanotechnology examines developments in three sub-fields: nanodrugs and drug delivery; prostheses and implants; and diagnostics and screening technologies. The authors compare new capabilities introduced by nanotechnology to traditional methods of release, target, and controlled drug delivery in the body. They also consider the challenge of understanding and controlling the biological processes involved upon implantation and discuss nanoscale sensors for biological chemical detection and biodefense. The book concludes with individual chapters devoted to the social and economic context of nanotechnologies and to their potential risks and possible solutions.\r\n\r\nBy outlining cutting-edge research in the context of pressing global medical needs and potential risks, this authoritative reference supplies a holistic treatment of biomedical nanotechnology that enables us to understand its implications and decide the best way to move forward","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5825cc2c579a64aea68e4a5ace80424a534dd877","amp;dn":"Biomedical+Nanotechnology+-+Neelina+H.+Malsch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5825cc2c579a64aea68e4a5ace80424a534dd877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,37,204,44,87,154,100,174,166,142,74,90,206,128,66,74,83,77,216,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
