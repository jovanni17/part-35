This book is designed to help you introduce young children to problem-solving strategies and algebraic-reasoning techniques, to give them practice with major number concepts and skills, and to motivate them to write and talk about big ideas in mathematics. It also sets the stage for the formal study of algebra in the upper grades.\n\nAlgebra Standards:\n\nThe National Council of Teachers of Mathematics identifies algebra as one of the five major content areas of the mathematics curriculum to be studied by children in all grades (NCTM,2000). The council emphasizes that early and regular experience with the key ideas of algebra helps students make the transition into the more formal study of algebra in late middle school or high school. This view is consistent with the general theory of learningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that understanding is enhanced when connections are made between what is new and what was previously studied.\n\nThe key algebraic concepts developed in this book are:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ representing quantitative relationships\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ representing unknowns with letters\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ reasoning about proportional relationships\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ identifying and continuing patterns\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ interpreting mathematical relationships\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ writing and solving equations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ solving for the values of one or two unknowns\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ replacing unknowns with their values","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb6bc6dffc58b6f683ac672973816ca193907d44","amp;dn":"Algebra+Readiness+-+Grade+1.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb6bc6dffc58b6f683ac672973816ca193907d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,107,198,223,252,88,182,246,131,172,103,41,115,129,108,161,147,144,125,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
