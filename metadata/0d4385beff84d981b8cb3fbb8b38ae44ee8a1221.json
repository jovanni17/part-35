This book examines the various adsorptive bubble separation techniques, including ion flotation, foam fractionation, precipitate flotation, mineral flotation, bubble fractionation, and solvent sublation.\r\nOrganized into 20 chapters, this book starts with an overview of the certain important properties of foam. This text then examines the results of several separations, as well as the results of additional studies into the mechanisms of the different techniques. Other chapters explain the studies of foam separation in the case of synthetic solutions, which provide a good knowledge of the extraction mechanisms of the radioactive cations, cesium, cerium, and strontium. This book discusses as well the experimental and theoretical work on foam separation done in Israel. The final chapter deals with the separation of surfactants and metallic ions at various places around the world.\r\nThis book is a valuable resource for materials scientists, engineers, and chemists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d4385beff84d981b8cb3fbb8b38ae44ee8a1221","amp;dn":"Adsorptive+Bubble+Separation+Techniques","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d4385beff84d981b8cb3fbb8b38ae44ee8a1221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,67,133,190,255,132,217,129,184,203,63,187,139,56,174,68,238,138,18,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
