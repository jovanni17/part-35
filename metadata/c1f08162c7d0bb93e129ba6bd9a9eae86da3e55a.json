Although the collection contains a lot of good blues and interesting covers, the EMI Legendary Masters Series single disc has all the earlier Sue Records hits, along with the later hits included here, and is better mastered and more sensibly ordered. For a two-disc set, there's an awful lot of stuff missing from this.\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n\r\nCD 1\r\n01. Proud Mary\r\n02. River Deep, Mountain High\r\n03. Sexy Ida (Part 1)\r\n04.
