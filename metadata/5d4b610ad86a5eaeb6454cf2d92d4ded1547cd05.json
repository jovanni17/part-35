This weekend on Moyers &amp; Company, Bill asks political communication expert Kathleen Hall Jamieson to decode the political misinformation campaigns of 2012 thus far.\n\nJamieson runs the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, including the sites FactCheck.org and FlackCheck.org.\n\n\n\nThe show then moves from politics to poetry as Bill welcomes former U.S. Poet Laureate Rita Dove, who this week received the National Medal of Arts from President Obama.\n\nDove was the youngest and the first African American to be named poet laureate in 1993. Through an intimate conversation and select readings, Moyers and Dove explore American history, language, culture and ideas.\n\nThey also talk about the responsibility ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and controversy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that comes with editing a prestigious anthology, as Dove was recently tasked for The Penguin Anthology of 20th Century American Poetry.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d4b610ad86a5eaeb6454cf2d92d4ded1547cd05","amp;dn":"Moyers+%26amp%3B+Company+-Decoding+the+Campaigns-PBS-02-17-2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d4b610ad86a5eaeb6454cf2d92d4ded1547cd05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,75,97,10,216,106,94,174,182,69,76,242,217,45,77,237,21,71,205,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
