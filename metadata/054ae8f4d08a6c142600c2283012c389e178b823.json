'There's\na million great songs written every day that you discover, and wish your friends\ncould appreciate as much as you do,' says singer/songwriter Adam Duritz. 'These\nsongs come from bands young and old, stretching from the early 60s to last year.\nThey're all great and will hopefully be heard by a few more people now.'\n\nProduced by Counting Crows and Shawn Dealey, Underwater Sunshine features tracks\nwritten by artists such as Big Star, Gram Parsons, Tender Mercies, Kasey\nAnderson and The Faces. Each rendition offers an entire spectrum of human\nemotion, delivered with the conviction and intense honesty the band is known\nfor.\n\nAs their first independent release, it was the right time for the Crows to make\nthis album. 'If you wonder why we didn t just write our own record, it s simply\nbecause we wanted to do THIS one,' says Duritz, We now have the creative freedom\nto release albums like this and offer our fans more music than ever.'\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:054ae8f4d08a6c142600c2283012c389e178b823","amp;dn":"Counting_Crows-Underwater_Sunshine_%28Or_What_We_Did_On_Our_Summer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"054ae8f4d08a6c142600c2283012c389e178b823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,74,232,244,208,138,108,20,38,0,194,40,48,18,195,137,225,120,184,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
