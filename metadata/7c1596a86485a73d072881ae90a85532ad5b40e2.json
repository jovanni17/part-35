Her assassin narrowly escapes the scene with his life, national security hot on his heels - or so it seems. Three months later, an elderly couple discover the body of a wounded man washed up on a beach. The young man (Dorff) cannot remember the slightest thing about his own identity. The only clue is a tattoo on his neck, &quot;XIII&quot;. Meanwhile, in the Whitehouse, government intelligence is still conducting the search for the President's killer. With the elections just weeks away, a confirmed suspect could swing the vote for the administration. Hours after XIII's location is picked up by covert intelligence, elite special ops forces are swarming the couple's house in Cape Fear. Running on adrenaline and instinct, XIII tactically takes out the soldiers one by one. On the run, clinging to one desperate clue after another, XIII begins to piece back his life, fragments of his memory returning. Finally captured, he learns that he has been given a stolen identity and placed undercover to flush out a group of conspirators threatening to overthrow the government. Ensconced within the highest echelons of power the conspirators run their own security agency alongside the Government's. Both are out to find him. The only way for XIII to get his own life back is to play bait. A dangerous game, especially when you don't know who you really are.\n\t \n          Release Date....: 2008.12.10\n          DVD Date........: 2008.12.03\n          Air Date........: 2008.10.06\n \n          Source..........: DVD\n          Network.........: NBC\n          Video...........: XviD\n          Video Bitrate...: 1071 kbit/s 2pass VBR\n          Audio...........: [X] VBR MP3 @ 48000 Hz\n                            [ ] AC3\n          Audio Bitrate...: 134 kbps\n          Duration........: 87 minutes\n          Resolution......: 624 x 352\n          Aspect Ratio....: 16:9\n          Frame Rate......: 25.000 \n          Size............: 50x15\n          Subtitles.......: None \n          Genre...........: Action | Adventure\n \n          URL.............: http://akas.imdb.com/title/tt1117667/\n                           \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c1596a86485a73d072881ae90a85532ad5b40e2","amp;dn":"XIII.2008.Miniseries.The.Conspiracy.DVDRip.XviD+%28Part+1+%26+2%29%C3%82%C2%A9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c1596a86485a73d072881ae90a85532ad5b40e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,21,150,168,100,133,167,61,7,40,129,174,144,168,85,50,173,91,64,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
