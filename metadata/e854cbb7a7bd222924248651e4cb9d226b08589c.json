A formidable boogie and blues pianist with a lovable growl of a voice, his most enduring achievements have fused New Orleans R&amp;B, rock, and Mardi Gras craziness to come up with his own brand of &quot;voodoo&quot; music. He's also quite accomplished and enjoyable when sticking to purely traditional forms of blues and R&amp;B. On record, he veers between the two approaches, making for an inconsistent and frequently frustrating legacy that often makes the listener feel as if &quot;the Night Tripper&quot; (as he's nicknamed himself) has been underachieving. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tNonesuch\nCatalogue:\t\t7559-79623-6\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Locked Down\n02.Revolution\n03.Big Shot\n04.Ice Age\n05.Getaway\n06.Kingdom Of Izzness\n07.You Lie\n08.Eleggua\n09.My Children, My Angels\n10.God's Sure Good\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e854cbb7a7bd222924248651e4cb9d226b08589c","amp;dn":"Dr.+John+-+Locked+Down+%282012%29+Flac+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e854cbb7a7bd222924248651e4cb9d226b08589c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,84,203,183,167,189,34,41,36,36,134,81,228,203,157,34,107,8,88,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
