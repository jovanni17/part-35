The problem is that none of those ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcookbooksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nprovide enough detail to really let you feel like you\nunderstand the program (blindly following the listed steps\njust doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do it), and all of the technical books are deep\ninto terms like rasters, vectors, and bit-depth settings. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nthe primary reason that most people arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t truly comfortable\nwith Photoshop. They either get the 1-2-3 steps (but\nno real understanding), or they get so many technical\nterms that Photoshop becomes impossible to grasp.\nSo how is this book different? Our approach is to use the\nsame language that you use in everyday life, to explain\neverything from the simplest feature to the most advanced\ntechniques. Ben Willmore acquired this approach as a\nresult of teaching tens of thousands of people in hundreds\nof seminars and hands-on workshops. We still provide a fair\nshare of step-by-step techniques, and we delve into some\nrather advanced features, but through it all we use metaphors\nand examples that make everything easy to understand\nand digest.\nOur mission is to help you graduate from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m just going\nthrough the motionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAt last, I really understand Photoshop.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nOnce youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve made that leap, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll experience an\nincredible ripple effect. Your effi ciency will skyrocket.\nYour costs will decrease. Your creative genius will come out\nof the closet like gangbusters, and your clients (or boss)\nwill be thrilled. But whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most important to us is that,\nthrough learning how to master Photoshop, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll fi nd the\npassion and energy that come from knowing youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re really\ngood at something.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f98b5abcaa9b514f714f2734298c6eae52f302","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+CS4+Studio+Techniques.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f98b5abcaa9b514f714f2734298c6eae52f302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,249,139,90,188,170,155,81,79,113,79,39,52,41,140,110,174,82,243,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
