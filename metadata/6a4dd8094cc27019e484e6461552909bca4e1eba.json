A must watch for anyone interested in the history of modern day Science and Technology and of course, Al-Andalus (Spain). \n\nThe contributions made by the Muslims of Spain during 8th-13th century. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interesting to note that modern day Spaniards are only now beginning to realize and  appreciate their Moorish history which is incredible in sense when you consider how Muslims during their pinnacle has contributed to the society across the World, \nbut at least the process has begun. The Spaniards of ancestral age were deliberately intent on hiding the Muslim History and achievements made by Muslims and Islam.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a4dd8094cc27019e484e6461552909bca4e1eba","amp;dn":"When+the+Moors+Ruled+in+Europe_DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a4dd8094cc27019e484e6461552909bca4e1eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,77,216,9,76,194,112,25,228,132,230,70,21,82,144,155,202,78,30,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
