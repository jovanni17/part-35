What about those famous actors that all the women (and yes, even some men) drool over?\n\nThe reality is, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a competitive world. Knowing how to dress, makes you stand out at the right moments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the professional world or on a date.\n\nIn this course weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to stick to the principles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the cuts, fabrics and other essentials to give you a sense of control of your wardrobe.\n\nHow much does this type of wardrobe cost you ask?\n\nThe key thing to understand that perhaps a Ã¢â‚¬Å“fashionistaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t is that dressing sharp isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about spending a ton of money on clothes.\n\nAfter over 6 years of consulting with thousands of men, and being featured on places like ABC, VH1, NBC and Askmen.com, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve put together a system designed to take you from dressing okay Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to the place you want to be.\n\nIn this program, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take you through:\n\nThe key mistakes many men make in the way they approach their personal style.\n\nA wardrobe inventory checklist that includes takeaways around every main clothing item from shoes, bottoms, shirts, suits to outerwear.\n\nThe process of taking each item you have and matching them appropriately Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a process that would cost you thousands of dollars if done by a professional style coach.\n\nThis system is made so that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to spend thousands on style consulting, but still be turned into the best version of you. No longer will you have to ask the question of Ã¢â‚¬Å“what goes with this?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b810acc9c8689c7fa11d5b68da2a9eaaa4a672be","amp;dn":"Aaron+Marino+-+Men%27s+Fashion+Style+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b810acc9c8689c7fa11d5b68da2a9eaaa4a672be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,16,172,201,200,104,156,127,161,29,91,104,218,42,158,170,164,166,114,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
