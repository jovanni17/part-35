ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the way it is made.\n\nSeed dam you SEE eeeee EED\nI cannot stress this enough as my upload speed is only 1 mbps so until a few people have it or part of it and seed back it is going to be slow going so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t complain if it takes 24 hours for the first few people to get it all and then a lot faster for others if they SEEEEED.\n\nWhen I first decided to do this, I thought it would be simple and quick, yeah right, 139 times give or take 1 it changes from one size to the other.\n\nAnyway original DVD was 720 x 480 the height of the IMAX parts so I trimmed 40 off top and bottom and on the standard bitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s besides chopping the black off I took 74 off the sides.  You really donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to miss anything and this makes both sizeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 400 high without stretching or distorting anything.\n\nOverall quality is okay but I feel that as a DVD rip itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not quite as crisp as other recent DVD rips but I feel that this is more because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a 2 hour and 40 minit movie crammed onto a DVD.\n\nMy understanding is that the blue ray played from a blue ray is astounding.  Well I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to keep blue ray size rips and DAM that size changing is annoying at least to me.\n\nSo enjoy and bloody SEEEEEEEEEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6aa6ec87429e555b1a656f686c641ff786a3819","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Knight+Rises+No+BLACK+BARS+All+the+same+ASPECT+Ratio+DV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6aa6ec87429e555b1a656f686c641ff786a3819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,170,110,200,116,41,229,85,177,166,86,246,134,198,65,255,120,106,56,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
