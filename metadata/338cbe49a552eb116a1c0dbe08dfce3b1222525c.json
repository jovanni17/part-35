The fictional comic's story, &quot;Marooned&quot;, is read by a black youth in New York City. Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of Watchmen experience superheroes in real life, &quot;they probably wouldn't be at all interested in superhero comics.&quot;[31] Gibbons suggested a pirate theme, and Moore agreed in part because he is &quot;a big Bertolt Brecht fan&quot;: the Black Freighter alludes to the song &quot;SeerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤uberjenny&quot; (&quot;Pirate Jenny&quot;) from Brecht's Threepenny Opera. Moore theorized that since superheroes existed, and existed as &quot;objects of fear, loathing, and scorn, the main superheroes quickly fell out of popularity in comic books, as we suggest. Mainly, genres like horror, science fiction, and piracy, particularly piracy, became prominent--with EC riding the crest of the wave.&quot; Moore felt that &quot;the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of Watchmen&quot;. The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presentation in the story would add subtext and allegory. The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of Tales of the Black Freighter at the end of issue five credits real-life artist Joe Orlando as a major contributor to the series. Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the Watchmen universe that DC editor Julius Schwartz might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book. Orlando contributed a drawing designed as if it were a page from the fake title to the supplemental piece.\n\n\nThis is the animated version of this story\n\n\n[Release Date] 24th March 2009\n[Quality]      DVD Rip\n\n\nUploaded by SELSYN\n\n\nPlease give credit if torrent is replicated\n\n\nPLEASE SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:338cbe49a552eb116a1c0dbe08dfce3b1222525c","amp;dn":"Watchmen-Tales.of.The.Black.Freighter%5B2009%5D%5BENG%5D%5BAVI%5D-SELSYN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"338cbe49a552eb116a1c0dbe08dfce3b1222525c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,140,190,73,165,82,235,17,106,28,13,190,8,223,206,59,18,34,82,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
