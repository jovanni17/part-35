One important domain is representation and processing of spatial information, needed, e.g., in geographical information systems. Spatial data types provide a fundamental abstraction for modeling the structure of geometric entities, their relationships, properties and operations. This monograph is an extensive survey of this field and introduces a new, general, sophisticated framework for the formal definition and robust implementation of spatial data types.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bae06a1820c1297a9f866305cc4f260a7e724ce","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1997%5D+Spatial+Data+Types+for+Database+Systems+Finite+Reso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bae06a1820c1297a9f866305cc4f260a7e724ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,174,6,161,130,12,18,151,169,248,102,48,92,196,242,96,167,231,36,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
