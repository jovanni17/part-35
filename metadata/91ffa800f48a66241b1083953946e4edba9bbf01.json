Since the original uploader hasn't keep up with new releases which solve the namespace issue that prevents using Daikon Forge with Playmaker, I edited the source code and commented out the offending lines: no DF-GUI Tooltips but everything else works as expected. Think of this release as a hotfix while somebody shares with us the newest versions.\n\n By the way, many Unity scripting assets released before Unity 4.5.x will probably need an upgrade and then again when Unity 5 becomes available. So it is time for registered users to upgrade their assets and share them again.\n\n Have fun and enjoy.
