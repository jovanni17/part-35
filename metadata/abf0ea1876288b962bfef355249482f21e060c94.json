Recent controversies, from revelations of rogue agents in the 1990s to incomplete pre- and post-9/11 intelligence, only emphasize how important it is to understand the role of espionage in our national defense.\nProduct Description\n\nIn two volumes, Spies, Wiretaps, and Secret Operation: An Encyclopedia of American Espionage ranges across history to provide a comprehensive, thoroughly up-to-date introduction to spying in the United StatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½why it is done, who does it (both for and against the United States), how it is done, and what its ultimate impact has been.\n\nThe encyclopedia includes hundreds of entries in chronologically organized sections that cover espionage by and within the United States from colonial times to the 21st century. Entries cover key individuals, technologies, and events in the history of American espionage. Volume two offers overviews of important agencies in the American intelligence community and intelligence organizations in other nations (both allies and adversaries), plus details of spy trade techniques, and a concluding section on the portrayal of espionage in literature and film. The result is a cornerstone resource that moves beyond the Cold War-centric focus of other works on the subject to offer an authoritative contemporary look at American espionage efforts past and present.\n\n\n    * Hardcover: 900 pages\n    * Publisher: ABC-CLIO (December 9, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1851098070\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1851098071","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abf0ea1876288b962bfef355249482f21e060c94","amp;dn":"Spies%2C+Wiretaps+and+Secet+Operations%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abf0ea1876288b962bfef355249482f21e060c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,240,234,24,118,40,139,150,43,254,243,85,36,148,130,242,30,6,12,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
