Thanks For the Grammy\n10. Speak of the Devil\n11. Push Pull\n\n====================================\nBy the time Jackyl recorded Cut the Crap, they had fallen out of the spotlight and were slugging it out on the hard rock/metal circuit without much success. Part of the problem was that the group&amp;#039;s novelty had faded away, and they weren&amp;#039;t even that interested in making ridiculous rockers like &quot;The Lumberjack&quot; anymore. So, what was left was a credible AC/DC rip-off that didn&amp;#039;t have as many hooks as AC/DC. Even if Cut the Crap isn&amp;#039;t much more than subpar Angus Young, it is a more inspired record than Night of the Living Dead and it occasionally does rock with energy, but it doesn&amp;#039;t have the weirdly bawdy humor that made Jackyl&amp;#039;s debut a guilty pleasure.\n\nThe song &quot;Locked and Loaded&quot; features AC/DC lead singer Brian Johnson as guest vocalist. The song is cowritten by Johnson as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:871aa6e017d81b1f64ca8ce824698615f05b5fb5","amp;dn":"Jackyl+-+Cut+The+Crap+%28VBR0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"871aa6e017d81b1f64ca8ce824698615f05b5fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,26,166,224,23,216,27,31,100,202,140,232,36,105,134,21,240,91,95,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
