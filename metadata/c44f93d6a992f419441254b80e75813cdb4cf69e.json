Their musical style encompassed rock and roll and swamp rock genres. Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins, they are sometimes also cited as southern rock stylists.\n\nCCR's music is still a staple of American and worldwide radio airplay and often figures in various media. The band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone. CCR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival is the first album by the American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, released in 1968.\n\nThe reissue liner notes state that while &quot;Suzie Q&quot; proved to be a hit, the band had played for years as the Golliwogs in the early 1960s, releasing numerous singles before achieving success in the pop world. While the band did gain success with their chart debut, critics initially denied the band any respect.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c44f93d6a992f419441254b80e75813cdb4cf69e","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival+-+I+Put+A+Spell+On+You+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c44f93d6a992f419441254b80e75813cdb4cf69e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,79,147,214,169,146,244,25,68,18,84,184,14,117,129,60,219,76,246,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
