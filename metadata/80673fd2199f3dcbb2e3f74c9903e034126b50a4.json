McKiernan was born April 4, 1932, in Moberly, Missouri, where he lived until age eighteen, when he joined the U.S. Air Force and served four years spanning the Korean War. \n\nHe received a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Missouri in 1958 and an M.S. in the same field from Duke University in 1964. He spent thirty-one years as one of the AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories whiz kids in research and development before changing careers to be a full-time writer.\n\nCurrently living in Tucson, Arizona, Dennis began writing novels in 1977 while recuperating from a close encounter of the crunch kind with a 1967 red and black Plymouth Fury (Dennis lost: it ran over him: Plymouth 1, Dennis 0). Among other hobbies, Dennis enjoys scuba diving, dirt-bike riding, and motorcycle touring - all enthusiasms shared by his wife.\n\nGenre: Fantasy\n\n\nInto the Forge (HÃƒÂ¨l's Crucible Duology #1) - Finally, the story of the Great War of the Ban is told! Two young wanderers are given a small copper coin by a dying human, who tells them to deliver it &quot;East to Agron&quot; and &quot;warn all, &quot; but dies before explaining who they are to deliver it to, and what they are to warn them of. Making matters worse, in order to deliver the message, the pair must pass through a war in the East between the Black Mage Modru and the alliance of free folk opposing him, and end up being drawn into events which threaten to overwhelm them, save for the coin which has much more significance than anyone could imagine!\n\nInto the Fire (HÃƒÂ¨l's Crucible Duology #2) - Tipperton and Beau, having delivered a mysterious coin to the reclusive King Agron, discover that the coin was actually a plea for help from King Blaine for aid in the Great War of the Ban. But the two adventurers are still not free from duty. Tip burns to avenge the death of his ladylove, fallen in battle, and Beau the healer cannot ignore the suffering of those around him. So they join the fight, leading Agron's army into the lands of their enemy, the Black Mage Modru, carrying with them an ancient prophecy of victory...or horrible defeat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80673fd2199f3dcbb2e3f74c9903e034126b50a4","amp;dn":"H%C3%A8l%27s+Crucible+Duology+by+Dennis+L.+McKiernan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80673fd2199f3dcbb2e3f74c9903e034126b50a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,103,63,210,25,159,61,203,178,227,247,76,153,3,224,52,18,107,80,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
