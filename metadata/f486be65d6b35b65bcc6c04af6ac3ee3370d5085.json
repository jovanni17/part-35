No more Healy.  :(  It seemed to take FOREVER for Cutler to master the volume levels in the stadiums and arenas.  However, the soundboard version here sounds great!!!\n\n\n'New Minglewood Blues' - interference at 6:34, 6:52, 6:57, 7:00 on - reportedly on all sources including audience sources.\n\n'So Many Roads' - interference at 4:13 through 4:28 - also on audience sources - you can hear audience react when interference ceases.\n\nThis is an upgrade from the previously seeded SHN of this show w/o the digistatic in Scarlet &gt; Fire and also a SBD of the encore.\n\n\nthanks to C. Miller for another awesome seed.\n\nDAE(EAC) &gt; boundaries confirmed on wavs (SHNTOOL) &gt; SHN(MKWACT) via C. Ladner.
