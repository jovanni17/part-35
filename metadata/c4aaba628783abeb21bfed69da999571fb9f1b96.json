His friend in his film club recovers the film testament after the police handle it. This young college student is inspired by the film and sets off with the deceased's ex-girlfriend to locate and re-create the places where he shot. The film has a Marxist agenda to it. All the members of the film club have strong leftist leanings and even participate in many demonstrations throughout Tokyo. \n\nThe Man Who Left His Will on Film is definitely Oshima's most experimental film so far, as many other critics and reviewers claim. Its like David Lynch and Seijun Suzuki collaboration to produce a disjointed film on film narrative.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4aaba628783abeb21bfed69da999571fb9f1b96","amp;dn":"The+Man+Who+Left+His+Will+On+Film+1970+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4aaba628783abeb21bfed69da999571fb9f1b96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,170,186,98,135,131,171,235,33,191,237,105,218,153,149,113,251,159,27,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
