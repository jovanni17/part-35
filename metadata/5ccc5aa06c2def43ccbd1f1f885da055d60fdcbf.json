The third robot is harder to fight and the girls are saved at the last minute by Johnny Banzai. Johnny immediately starts to woo the grateful Vampirella, but Pantha smells a rat. It turns out that Johnny is responsible for the city wrecking robots, which he created so he could impress Vampirella when he &quot;defeated&quot; them.\n\nVampirella smashes his remote control panel and the robot goes on the rampage for real. Using Johnny as a human missile she defeats the robot and she and Pantha slink off into the sunset.\n\nA slightly tongue in cheek story in true manga style - both artwork and storytelling.\n\nThanks goes to Talon for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
