An all-star cast headed by Barbara Cook, Vanessa Williams and Tom Wopat takes on new arrangements of over two-dozen Sondheim tunes, ranging from the beloved to the obscure, interspersed with audio commentary by the composer himself, who reveals fascinating details about his life and his art. Stephen Sondheim's final word on his unparalleled body of work has been preserved by PS Classics in this lavish release.
