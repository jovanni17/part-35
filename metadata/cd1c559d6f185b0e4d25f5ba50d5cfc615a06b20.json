The real-life model for The Great Gatsby's Meyer Wolfsheim and Nathan Detroit from Guys and Dolls, Rothstein was much moreÃ¢â‚¬â€and lessÃ¢â‚¬â€than a fixer of baseball games. He was everything that made 1920s Manhattan roar. Featuring Jazz Age Broadway with its thugs, speakeasies, showgirls, political movers and shakers, and stars of the Golden Age of Sports, this is a biography of the man who dominated an age. Arnold Rothstein was a loan shark, pool shark, bookmaker, thief, fence of stolen property, political fixer, Wall Street swindler, labor racketeer, rumrunner, and mastermind of the modern drug trade. Among his monikers were &quot;The Big Bankroll,&quot; &quot;The Brain,&quot; and &quot;The Man Uptown.&quot; This vivid account of Rothstein's life is also the story of con artists, crooked cops, politicians, gang lords, newsmen, speakeasy owners, gamblers and the like. Finally unraveling the mystery of Rothstein's November 1928 murder in a Times Square hotel room, David Pietrusza has cemented The Big Bankroll's place among the most influential and fascinating legendary American criminals. 16 pages of black-and-white photographs are featured.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd1c559d6f185b0e4d25f5ba50d5cfc615a06b20","amp;dn":"Rothstein%3A+The+Life%2C+Times%2C+and+Murder+of+the+Criminal+Genius+Wh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd1c559d6f185b0e4d25f5ba50d5cfc615a06b20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,28,85,157,111,24,91,14,77,37,245,186,80,213,207,198,21,160,107,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
