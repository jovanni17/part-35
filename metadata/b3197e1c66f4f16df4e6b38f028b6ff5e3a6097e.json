Create your own charts and monitor the coming changes leading to Dec 21,2012 as the ZERO date on the chart, or alternatively see where history has been in the past on the chart.\n\nFile Descriptions below;\n\nTimewave Zero v4.30 for DOS is a precision instrument for exploring the theory of time as a fractal wave derived from the King Wen sequence of I Ching Hexagrams. Based on extraterrestrial communications to Terence McKenna. Software developed by Peter Meyer. Published by Dolphin Software.\nFractal Time v1.23 by Peter Meyer.\nwen_grph.zip takes a representation of a hexagram sequence, constructs the intermediate graphs then calculates the 384 data points. Author: Peter Meyer\ntw.zip calculates the value of the timewave at a point.
