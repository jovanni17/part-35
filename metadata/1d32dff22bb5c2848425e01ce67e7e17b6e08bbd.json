HERES THE INFO THAT CAME WITH THIS TORRENT...\n\n=====================================================================================\n=====================================================================================\n\nThis was originally released at http://djdiamonddog.com in 2008 with a good amount of success. Part 2 will be in the lab this year, so I decided to put this one on some torrent sites (plus I just learned how to do torrents). This mixtape is, basically, one big rock/rap mashup cd with some classics and some newer music (from 2008 that is). If you are reading this &amp; you enjoy both hip hop and rock &amp; roll, then you will definitely enjoy this mix cd.\n\nThis torrent comes complete with a cue file to seperate the tracks on disc when you burn it. If you're worried about burning software, then there's also a link to FREE burning software that supports cue files. It also has the album art and a help file.\n\n\nTrack List...\n\n1. Intro\n2.
