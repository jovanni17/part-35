It was released on April 26, 2008.\n\nThe album features 18 songs of Leith's interpretations from the 1960s and 1970s that inspired and captured his spirit at a young age. &quot;The great songwriters of the 60s and 70s have always been a major influence on my own original material. In many ways the songs of that generation are as relevant today as they were back then. I've chosen songs that either mean a great deal to me on a personal level or those that I'd just love people to hear.&quot;\n\nThe album debuted at number three on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart, selling 9,688 copies in its first week.[1] In the following week, in the lead up to Mother's Day, the album rose to number two. Selling over 17,000 units, the album lost the top position by less than 300 copies.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. Catch the Wind\n   2. Annie's Song\n   3. Wild World\n   4. If\n   5.
