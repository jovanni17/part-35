It stars Tom Cruise, who reprises his role of IMF Agent Ethan Hunt, and is director Brad Bird's first live-action film. Ghost Protocol was written by AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Nemec and Josh Appelbaum, and produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams (director of the third film) and Bryan Burk. It is the first Mission: Impossible film not produced by Paula Wagner, and the first of the series to be partially filmed using IMAX cameras. The film was released in North America on December 16, 2011, to favorable reviews.\n\n\n\n* PLOT :\n\nOn assignment in Budapest to intercept a courier working for a person of interest code-named &quot;Cobalt&quot;, IMF agent Trevor Hanaway is killed by an assassin named Sabine Moreau. Hanaway's team leader, Jane Carter, and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn extract Ethan Hunt and Hunt's source Bogdan from a Moscow prison. Hunt is recruited to lead Carter and Dunn to infiltrate the secret Moscow Kremlin archives and locate files identifying Cobalt. Partway through the mission, someone broadcasts across the IMF frequency, alerting the Russians to Hunt's team. Although Hunt, Dunn, and Carter escape, a bomb destroys the Kremlin, and Russian agent Sidirov accuses Hunt of masterminding the attack.\nThe IMF extracts Hunt from Moscow. The Russians have called the attack an undeclared act of war, and the US president activates &quot;Ghost Protocol&quot;, a black operation contingency that disavows the entire IMF. Hunt and team are to take the blame for the attack, but they will be allowed to escape from government custody so that they may operate to track down Cobalt. \nBefore Hunt can escape, the IMF's secretary is killed by Russian security forces led by Sidirov, leaving Hunt and intelligence analyst William Brandt to find their own way out. The team identifies Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist who believes the weak must die for the strong to survive, so he plans to start a nuclear war to initiate the next stage of human evolution. Hendricks bombed the Kremlin and acquired a Russian nuclear launch-control device, and now needs its codes from the Budapest courier in order to launch a nuclear missile at America.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2011 *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cabd317b058519b51186262de67f6487db3df982","amp;dn":"MISSION+IMPOSSIBLE+GHOST+PROTOCOL+RMVB+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cabd317b058519b51186262de67f6487db3df982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,189,49,123,5,133,25,181,17,134,38,45,230,127,100,135,219,61,249,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
