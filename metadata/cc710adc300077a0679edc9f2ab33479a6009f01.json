You ask the spectator to cut the deck near the middle and look at either the card at the bottom of the cut packet and remember it. The spectator then replaces the packet back on the deck and the force is completed. You now know exactly what card they are thinking of, its only a matter of how to reveal it.\n\n_____ _____________________________________\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc710adc300077a0679edc9f2ab33479a6009f01","amp;dn":"CUT+-+Daniel+Madison+%5BOPiiUM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc710adc300077a0679edc9f2ab33479a6009f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,113,10,220,48,0,119,160,103,158,220,159,42,179,52,121,166,0,159,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
