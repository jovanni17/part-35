The further you are, the safer it is to look.\n*  Your flashlight has a limited battery; it will not drain while it is turned off.  You also can look at the\nSlender Man longer while it is off.  However, having it off will make you easier to catch.\n*  Jogging/sprinting causes your stamina to drop; it recovers when walking, and recovers twice as fast when \nstanding still.\n*  Sprinting causes your maximum stamina to drop slightly; jogging does not.\n\nUploaded By:Blaad11","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:595cec5315fe53d6cefd9b24e7ccac97d0cb3c95","amp;dn":"SLENDER%3A+THE+EIGHT+PAGES+%28v0.9.7%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"595cec5315fe53d6cefd9b24e7ccac97d0cb3c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,92,236,83,21,254,83,214,206,253,155,36,231,204,172,151,208,203,60,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
