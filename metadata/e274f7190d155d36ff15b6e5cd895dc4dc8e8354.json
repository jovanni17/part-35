Since 2003, he has given concerts in sixteen different states to benefit organizations such as The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Race for the Cure, Baltimore Reads, The Maryland Food Bank, The Matthey Foster Foundation, and Tsunami Relief. Michael also donates a portion of all personal proceeds to The National Multiple Sclerosis Society to fight the disease that destroyed his grandmother's life.\n\nIn 2005, Michael performed at the anime convention Otakon for an audience of three thousand people, and later that year, he was featured on MTV's website in recognition for his contributions to the world of videogame music. In 2007, Michael released his debut album, entitled GAME, which became the first videogame and anime piano solo CD to be published by an independent musician.\n\nVisit Piano Squall online at www.PianoSquall.com.\n\n\nScars of Time, Frog's Theme, Decisive Battle with Magus, 1,000 Words, Kiss Me Goodbye, The Prelude, Ending Theme, Battle with Gilgamesh, Dancing Mad, The Last Battle, Fight 2, Normal Battle, The Decisive Battle, Those Who Fight Further, Liberi Fatali, One Winged Angel, Victory Fanfare ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2007 Square Enix.
