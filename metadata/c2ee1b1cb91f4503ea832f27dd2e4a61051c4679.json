The flavour is everything\nHere we present a selection of funky tracks from a rich period in the history of southern soul.\n\n\nSee inner sleeve (below) for more details\n\n400 dpi sleeve scans:\nOuter - http://img.cx/6NEW.jpg \nInner - http://img.cx/HLJ6.jpg\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2ee1b1cb91f4503ea832f27dd2e4a61051c4679","amp;dn":"VA+-+Southern+Fried+Funk+%5BFLAC%2BCUE%2BLOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2ee1b1cb91f4503ea832f27dd2e4a61051c4679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,238,27,28,185,31,69,3,234,131,47,39,221,46,74,97,5,28,70,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
