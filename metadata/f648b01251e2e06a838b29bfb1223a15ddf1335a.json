Det fins en Prins\n2. Stridens Hus\n3. Cold (The Cure cover)\n4. Manndaudsvinter\n\n\nTaake (Norwegian pronunciation: [Ã‹Ë†toÃ‹ï¿½kÃ‰â„¢]) is the solo vehicle of Ulvhedin HÃƒÂ¸st (ÃƒËœrjan Stedjeberg), also known as HÃƒÂ¸st or Hoest. The band was formed in Norway (Bergen, Hordaland). During 1993, originally billed as Thule, Hoest proceeded to issue a brace of demos in 1993Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœDer Vinterstormene RastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and 1994Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœOmfarnet Av Svarte VingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ prior to adopting the new title of Taake. Billed as Taake, Hoest, together with Svartulv and Dim, the group cut the 1995 cassette Ã¢â‚¬ËœManndaudsvinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. A three track 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ EP, issued by HoestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Mosegrodd Productions, arrived the same year with Hoest handling vocals, bass and guitar and Svartulv retained as drummer.\n\nTaakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next move was to release the debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœNattestid Ser Porten VidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ through the Wounded Love label. For these recordings session drummerTundra (a.k.a. Hans Helander) of Frostmoon and Tundra was employed.\n\nA second album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœOver Bjoergvin Graater HimmerikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, witnessed the induction of a brand new band unit comprising of Gigantomachy guitarist C. Corax, Vendigeit bassist / keyboard player Keridwen and drummer Mutt of Gaahlskagg, Trelldom and Sigfader. However, studio time would be interrupted when Corax was imprisoned. The band finalised the recordings upon CoraxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release from jail in late December of 2000.\n\nCorax would leave the fold in August of 2001 and Mutt followed suit in January of the following year. Nevertheless, Hoest regrouped for a tour of Germany, Taake now including Hoest on vocals and bass, Keridwen on guitar, Drakkhian of French acts Griffar and Black Dementia on second guitar and drummer T.H. Gjengedal.\n\nIn 2004, Taake signed a deal with Dark Essence Records and recorded their third album Ã¢â‚¬ËœHordalands doedskvadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in Grieghallen studios. Ã¢â‚¬ËœDoedskvadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was released in 2005, again with Corax on guitar.\n\nIn 2006, Hoest was imprisoned for a period for assault (HoestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exact words were Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was reported to the police by an individual whose face I so elegantly rearranged due to his unacceptable behaviourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) putting TaakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s progress on hold.\n\nWith Hoest out of prison, Taake embarked upon a European tour with Koldbrann and Urgehal. The fourth full-length Taake album, simply titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœTaakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, was released in late 2008 after work was completed upon HoestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release from prison. An EP Ã¢â‚¬ËœSvartekunstÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was also released in early 2008, but was not intended as a preview of the newer full length album.\n\ntogether with Svartulv and Dim, the group cut the 1995 cassette Ã¢â‚¬ËœManndaudsvinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.
