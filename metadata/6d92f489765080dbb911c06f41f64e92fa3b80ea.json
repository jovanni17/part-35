Side one of The Terminator \nis comprised of six compositions by Fiedel, who once served as a keyboardist for \nHall &amp; Oates briefly in the mid-1970s. &quot;The Terminator Theme&quot; is a spectacular \npiece of haunting synthesizer music; each layer is perfectly effective, \nespecially the deceptively simple melody line. &quot;Tunnel Chase&quot; is bombastically \nchilling while &quot;Love Scene&quot; is a soft, mournful piano-based version of the main \ntheme; its bittersweet feel corresponds nicely to the pivotal scene that it \nsupports. Fiedel's synthesizer work on &quot;Factory Chase&quot; is full of glassy squeals \nand scary bursts, and Ross Levinson adds touches of electric violin. Side two \nconsists of generic, mid-1980s synthesizer-based, dance-oriented pop/rock, but \nthat makes sense since most of these songs were used in club scenes in the film. \nTahnee Cain and Tryanglz contribute three songs (Cain, aka Tane Cain, was \nmarried to keyboardist Jonathan Cain of the Babys and Journey); all three have \ntypical hard-rock rhythm guitar and flashy solos, but the best one is &quot;Burnin' \nin the Third Degree.&quot; The Jay Ferguson and 16mm cut &quot;Pictures of You&quot; is really \nonly notable because the emphasis on quirky synthesizers is so different from \nFerguson's solo rock hits &quot;Thunder Island&quot; and &quot;Shakedown Cruise.&quot; The \nhyperactive Linn Van Hek song &quot;Intimacy&quot; is a mixture of latter-day new wave and \nprimitive, early techno. The Terminator was reissued on CD in 1991 by DCC \nCompact Classics. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.
