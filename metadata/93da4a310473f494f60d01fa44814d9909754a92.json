His native state has given him \nplenty of roadhouse troubadours to emulate, a loyal audience that embraces \nhim as its own, and the pick of Austin-based musicians to add substance to an \nartistry that might otherwise seem pretty shallow. Co-produced by the \nubiquitous Lloyd Maines (Joe Ely, Jerry Jeff Walker, Pat Green), Morrow's \nmusic substitutes pleasant and sincere for striking and original. Though he \nshows more thematic ambition than on previous releases (reaching a little too \nfar on the vaguely spiritual &quot;In Spite of Spite&quot;), his material still tends toward \nthe clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©d (&quot;Take Me Away&quot;) and the generic (&quot;Dance by the Rio Grande&quot;). A \nserviceable cover of the Grateful Dead's &quot;Friend of the Devil&quot; highlights that \nsong's bluegrass roots, while Morrow's version of Drivin N Cryin's &quot;Straight to \nHell&quot; bristles with more conviction than he brings to his own material. --Don \nMcLeese\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93da4a310473f494f60d01fa44814d9909754a92","amp;dn":"Cory+Morrow+-+Outside+the+Lines+%5B2002%2F192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93da4a310473f494f60d01fa44814d9909754a92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,218,74,49,4,115,244,148,246,13,1,250,68,129,77,153,9,117,74,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
