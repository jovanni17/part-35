It feels perfect in every way - except that she is used to caviar and Manolo Blahniks, and he is used to burgers and flip-flops. She is a guest at the luxurious hotel - he lives above a garage.\n\nSo when Ned's cousin offers to cut him in on a rich deal he's been commissioned to execute, Ned can't turn him down. The plan is simple, just a fast break-and-enter. The risk is high, and the reward is even greater--$5 million. But on the night of the heist, something goes devastatingly wrong. Who will save the lifeguard?\n\nNed walks away from his job, his town, and the woman he's fallen in love with. Runs away, actually, knowing that only velocity and secrecy can save his life. But who is pursuing him? The FBI? Whoever sabotaged the heist? Or is it all somehow tied into his new love - and his oldest enemies?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cef70badb6d8e96cd52f200633db6379575eeaa5","amp;dn":"James+Patterson+-+Lifeguard+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cef70badb6d8e96cd52f200633db6379575eeaa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,247,11,173,182,216,233,108,213,47,32,6,51,219,99,121,87,94,234,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
