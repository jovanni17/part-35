And they meet one man who has dedicated his life to freeing them; Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa is the only hope many of these children have.\n\nBurundi has no juvenile justice system and children above the age of 15 are tried as adults. By law any child under that age should not be imprisoned, but in a country recovering from civil war and where record keeping is scant, many underage children are slipping through the net and are being locked up.\n\nFile Name .............: Unreported World S21E06 (13 May 2011)[PDTV(XviD)].avi\n\n\nCap:\tgeclipse\nSource: https://thebox.bz/details.php?id=157702\n\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3623e40db7a2309cc943bf58c0996ab648d28561","amp;dn":"Unreported+World++-+Burundi+Boys+Behind+Bars++++2011+05+13+++Ch4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3623e40db7a2309cc943bf58c0996ab648d28561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,35,228,13,183,162,48,156,201,67,191,88,192,153,106,182,72,210,133,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
