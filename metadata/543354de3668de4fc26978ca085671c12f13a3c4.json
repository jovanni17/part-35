In the week before Jack plans to marry, the pair heads out from Los Angeles to the Santa Ynez wine country. For Jack, the tasting tour is Seven Days to D-Day, his final stretch of freedom. For Miles, who has divorced his wife, is facing an uncertain career, and has lost his passion for living, the trip is a week-long opportunity to evaluate his past, his future, and himself. A raucous and surprising novel filled with wonderful details about wine, Sideways is also a thought-provoking and funny book about men, women, and human relationships.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543354de3668de4fc26978ca085671c12f13a3c4","amp;dn":"Sideways+audiobook+Part+2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543354de3668de4fc26978ca085671c12f13a3c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,51,84,222,54,104,222,79,194,105,120,202,8,86,113,193,47,19,163,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
