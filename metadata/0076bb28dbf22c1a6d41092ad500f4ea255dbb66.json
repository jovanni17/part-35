That it took Clapton so long to go out on his own, however, was evidence of a degree of reticence unusual for one of his stature. And his debut album, though it spawned the Top 40 hit &quot;After Midnight,&quot; was typical of his self-effacing approach: it was, in effect, an album by the group he had lately been featured in, Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t16975-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.89% CDDA &amp; 99.94% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.
