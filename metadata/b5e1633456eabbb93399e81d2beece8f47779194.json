These are the ones I'd like to propose you. Most of these come from my\ncassettes collection, so they will be released at a slower pace than my Master Series! But you won't be disappointed!\nI will try to gather the most unusual things I have in my collection and, as always, your feedback and comments will be my reward for all the work involved in this project.\n\nDO NOT share this music on mp3, just convert it for your own use. Sharing mp3's is the right way to make me stop sharing\nmusic here. \n\nPINK FLOYD\nLondon, Rainbow theatre\nFebruary 17, 1972\n\nA SIDE:\n\n01.Breathe \n02.On The Run (variation)\n03.Time / A Great Gig In The Sky (variation)\n\nB SIDE:\n \n04.A Great Gig In The Sky (variation) / Money \n05.Us And Them \n06.Any Colour You Like \n07.Brain Damage \n08.Eclipse\n\nTT 42:23\n\nLineage: Vinyl LP (In Celebration Of The Comet - The Coming Of Kahoutek) &gt; 1st generation copy &gt; Aiwa Tape Deck TC-WE475 &gt; Audiophile 2496 &gt; HD &gt; SoundForge 7.0 &gt; CD Wave &gt; FLAC Frontend (level 6) \n\nDavid Gilmour (Guitar, Vocals)\nNick Mason (Drums)\nRichard Wright (Keyboards)\nRoger Waters (Bass Guitar, Vocals)\n\nTaken from a direct rip of the original vinyl, here is a great early version of The Dark Side Of The Moon album as recorded by the BBC from the Rainbow in London. Sound is pristine. Pretty much well circulated Roio among the floyd community but in case you missed this one now it's the time! Some debate whatever this comes from the 17th or the 20th.\n\nDefinitely worth a listen!\n\nldb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e1633456eabbb93399e81d2beece8f47779194","amp;dn":"In+Celebration+of+the+Comet+-+The+Coming+of+Kahoutek+-+Pink+Floy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e1633456eabbb93399e81d2beece8f47779194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,225,99,52,86,234,187,185,51,153,232,29,43,238,206,143,71,119,145,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
