The whole world outside the Compound is living proof that everything in NeelyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life was a lie manufactured by the Elders, which may even include the boy she loves.\n\nAll Neely wants is the truth, but each new piece of it drives her further from what she thought she knew. With only forty days until everyone she loves falls under the EldersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mind control, Neely must decipher who to trust, what questions to ask, and how to get one step ahead of the Elders, who will do anything to keep their secrets buried","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb75670d20b494e2b590a1e9c0664d0265178f5e","amp;dn":"Follow+Me+Through+Darkness+by+Danielle+Ellison+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb75670d20b494e2b590a1e9c0664d0265178f5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,117,103,13,32,180,148,226,181,144,161,233,192,102,77,2,101,23,143,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
