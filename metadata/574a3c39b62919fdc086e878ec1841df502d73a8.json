At least that is until they suffer their first loss of important data as a result of software, hardware or user error: thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when it becomes crystal clear just how valuable a reliable and up-to-date backup really is.\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the safest and easiest way to avoid losing important data! O&amp;O DiskImage 8 lets you backup an entire computer and everything on it whenever you want Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even while the computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being used. In the event data loss should ever occur, your data can be quickly restored with just a few mouse clicks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even when Windows is no longer able to start.\nAll default and advanced features are combined in one single product. Options are available for both automated and manual settings. Thanks to a unique recovery system that includes additional system recovery tools along with O&amp;O DIskImage, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll quickly be able to restore all your important data Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even if the backup youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using was created with an older O&amp;O DiskImage version.\n\nFeatures:\n\nBackup entire PCs, individual drives, or files with the push of a button\n\nWhen backing up a PC, O&amp;O DiskImage saves all personal files as well as drive information and individual settings. This not only protects irreplaceable files, but in a worst case scenario, also saves you the trouble of having to carry out a time-consuming new setup of programs and the Windows operating system. O&amp;O DiskImage lets you back up an entire computer, system and data drives, or individual files and folders.\n\nBackups on a regular basis protect against data loss\n\nTo make sure your backups are always up to date, we recommend creating them at short intervals from one another. O&amp;O DiskImage can be set to do this automatically so that data can be backed up, for example, once a week. To save disk space, you can set the maximum number of backups that should be saved so that old ones are automatically replaced by new ones.\n\nQuick and easy restoration, even on a different hardware\n\nRestoring a backup with O&amp;O DiskImage is as easy as pie: all you have to do is start the program, select the backup you want to restore, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re off. Included with the product is our machine independent restoration which means your old backup can be transferred 1:1 onto a new machine. Hardware of a different make will be automatically recognized and Windows settings will be carried out by themselves. And if you only need to restore a single file or folder, you can mount the backup as a virtual drive and then using Windows Explorer, simply select and copy whatever you want. Nothing could be easier!\n\nPlug-and -play functionality\n\nWhoever wants to save data on an external disk has it even easier with the new O&amp;O DiskImage 8. Thanks to its integrated plug-and -play option, selected files and folders can be backed up and synchronized automatically as soon as, for example, an external hard disk is connected to the computer. Ideal for users who are happy to forget about making backups or who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to go through the trouble. Once configured, everything runs by itself.\n\nCreate a boot medium directly from within the program\n\nO&amp;O DiskImage can bring a system back to life immediately, and with no installation required. It does so by way of a Boot Medium (USB Stick or CD/DVD) which is based on current installed Windows system and which contains all standard drivers.\n\nImaging Features:\n\nNEW: Direct creation of VHDs\nNEW: Simplified wizard for creating and modifying jobs\nOPTIMIZED: Creating jobs with the Windows Task Scheduler\nImage an entire computer with the push of a button\nImage system and data drives\nClone drives and entire disks\nFile backup: image and restore individual files and/or folders\nMonitoring and warning of security risks\nImage only used sectors\nIncremental/differential images: backup only the changes\nSave images to network drives\nTime Schedule for automatic, regular images\nAdvanced burning on CD/DVD/Blu-ray\n\nRestoration Features:\n\nSupports EFI/UEFI systems as well as BIOS\nEasily restore files, folders, drives and disks\nRestoring onto different hardware (M.I.R.)\nBoot media based on Windows contains extra system rescue tools\nDirect restoration from virtual disks (VHD)\n\nTools\n\nNEW: Start a job by connecting a device\nCreate a boot CD from the program itself (starting from Windows 7)\nEven simpler and quicker user interface\nHigh-performance compression and encryption of images\nSupport for dynamic and GPT volumes\nExclude certain files and/or file types\nCheck drives and images for errors\nAdvanced report management and e-mail notifications\nLive Update: Automatic Updates to current Program Versions\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMinimum requirements of the respective system\nAn internet connection is required to download the latest program components and to create a boot medium\nAt least 1 GB RAM recommended\n30 MB free hard disk space\n32/64-bit Support\nWindowsÃ‚Â® 8.1 8, 7, VistaÃ‚Â®, and XP (all Editions)\n\nHomepage: http://www.oo-software.com/en/products/oodiskimage\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n1.
