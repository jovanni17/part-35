He spent years of his life in research on Swami Vivekananda.\n\nThe English biography of Swamiji (and surely ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Complete Works of Swami VivekanandaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) is the best source for knowing Swamiji and his teachings. Beyond that there lie the reminiscences of people who saw him. Swami Nirlepananda met as many such people as he could. He tells that who ever, a sanyasi, a brahmachari or even a common man or a housewife, from each and every nooks and corners of the society, came in touch of Swami Vivekananda has attained some invincible impression of this great monk.\n\nSwami Nirlepananda collected all such recollections what ever available and published those in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“UdbadhanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ magazine more than 50 years back and later in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SudarshanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ magazine (that too more than at least 30 years back). Later all those reminiscences were published as a book named ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Swamijir SmritiSanchayanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Sadly enough this book is out of print since long (may be because of some memories of people that contradicts those published by Ramakrishna Mission at the present days, [these are at page no. 25, 38, 60 and etc.], but these were first published in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“UdbadhanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ magazine of Ramakrishna Mission itself!).\n\nI personally believe that this book is a must to read one for each and every Swami Vivekananda-lovers and for those who want to know the Swamiji from different perspectives of life. As these reminiscences vary across a wide sections of people they amply present different types of views of people who saw Swamiji depending on their personal experiences, capabilities and view points.\n\nName of The Book : Swamijir SmritiSanchayan\nLanguage : Bengali\nSubject : Religious/Biography\nAuthor : Swami Nirlepananda\nPublisher : Karuna Prakashani\nYear of Print : 1967\n\nSeeding Time : Usually, 2am-8am IST (upto 7:30 am on Saturdays)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5d5163959f61fb29de68de3b1f2eae88ea2a05e","amp;dn":"Swamijir+SmritiSanchayan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5d5163959f61fb29de68de3b1f2eae88ea2a05e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,213,22,57,89,246,31,178,157,230,141,227,177,242,234,232,142,162,160,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
