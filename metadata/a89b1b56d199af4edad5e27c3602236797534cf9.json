Johnny &quot;Hammond&quot; Smith began his career as a simple soul jazz organist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but by the time of this album, he'd teamed up with the mighty Larry Mizell, the genius arranger/producer who'd breathed new life into the careers of Donald Byrd and Bobbi Humphrey. Mizell works with Hammond in the same way he does with other jazz artists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by taking a groove that works best with their solo style, and slowly layering other instrumentation and effects on top of it, so that when the solo kicks in, it's supported on waves and waves of funky sounds and soulful grooves.\n\nMizell and his brother Fonce both play keyboards on the record, and the rest of the group includes monster fusion players like Harvey Mason, Roger Glenn, Hadley Caliman, and Jerry Peters. The real treat is Johnny, though Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as his solos are heavenly, the best of his 70s work, stripped mean and lean, laid in at just the right points. Includes the breakbeat classic &quot;Shifting Gears&quot;, the house classic &quot;Los Conquistadores Chocolates&quot;, and funky numbers &quot;Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Tell Me What To Do&quot;.\n\n----------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n----------------------------------------\n\n01 - Tell Me What To Do\n02 - Los Conquistadores Chocolates\n03 - Lost On 23rd Street\n04 - Fantasy\n05 - Shifting Gears\n06 - Can't We Smile\n\n*2014 Milestone / Fantasy / Universal Music Japan | UCC0-90336\n{2014 Japan Rare Groove Funk Best Collection 1000}\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJohnny &quot;Hammond&quot; Smith - Organ, Synthesizer, Electric Piano\nLarry Mizell - Keyboards (Solina), Backing Vocals\nFonce Mizell - Clavinet, Backing Vocals\nJerry Peters - Electric Piano, Piano\nHarvey Mason - Drums\nChuck Rainey - Electric Bass\nCraig McMullen, John Rowin - Guitar\nRoger Glenn - Flute, Vibraphone\nKenneth Nash - Cymbal, Gong, Percussion\nHadley Caliman - Tenor Saxophone\nJulian Priester - Trombone\nMichael White - Violin\n\n\nNEXT -&gt; More 2014 Japan Rare Groove Funk Best Collection 1000...\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a89b1b56d199af4edad5e27c3602236797534cf9","amp;dn":"Johnny+Hammond+-+Gears+%281975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a89b1b56d199af4edad5e27c3602236797534cf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,155,27,86,209,153,175,78,218,213,226,124,54,2,35,103,151,83,76,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
