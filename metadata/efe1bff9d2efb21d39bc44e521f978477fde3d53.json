Everyone's favorite teacher, Mr. Simon (Ed Harris), pairs Andy with the school's biggest outcast and social pariah, Stanley, aka &quot;Big G&quot; (Alexander Walters), on a critical term project. Sporting thick orange hair, a head too big for his body and ears too big for his head, &quot;Big G&quot; has been the object of ridicule since grade school. Before long, Andy will learn that there was truly a method behind Mr. Simon's madness as to why he teamed these two up. As the story unfolds, Mr. Simon finds himself the target of a malicious rumor after Principal Kelner (Amy Madigan) suspends a school bully for brutally beating up a female classmate whom he thinks has &quot;cooties.&quot; When Andy watches &quot;Big G&quot; fearlessly confront the school bully, a series of events are triggered which change the lives of both young men - and their teacher - forever. Much to Andy's surprise, &quot;Big G&quot; is a brilliant, kind, tolerant and decent human being who has more dignity than anyone Andy has ever encountered.                \r\n\r\nYear: 2011                \r\nDirector: Michael Pavone                \r\nWriters: Michael Pavone                \r\nStars: Ed Harris, Chase Ellison, Molly Parker, Daniel Roebuck, Randy Orton, Daniel Yelsky, Alexander Walters, Mia Rose Frampton, Amy Madigan, Camille E.
