He performed at talent shows, open micÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, house parties and local events. In 1999 he signed a record deal with a city-known drug dealer and childhood friend, and again with another big time drug dealer the following year. Because of EshonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Godly convictions neither venture ever progressed into anything.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - November 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca8e94f5f298694283cc59bb385366856301537","amp;dn":"Eshon+Burgundy+Discography+2008-2012+%286+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca8e94f5f298694283cc59bb385366856301537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,168,233,79,95,41,134,148,40,60,197,155,179,133,54,104,86,48,21,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
