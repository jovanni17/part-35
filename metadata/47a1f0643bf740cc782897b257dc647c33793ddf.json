Also, the video contains hardcoded foreign subtitles\nThey aren't visible all of the time, due to the cropping and camera movement\nOne last thing, I tagged this as a CAM because in my opinion there is no way that this is a TS\n\nSource was actually nice for a first CAM. I started by dropping the rmvb file into VDub\nFirst thing I did was crop the video so you can't see half of the actual cinema around the film\nOnce I got it to the way I wanted I used a few filters to touch up the quality of the video\ntweaked the RGB, Contrast/Brightness, HSV levels and a slight sharpen. That's pretty much it\nnot bad at all for a first CAM, more than watchable but many will disagree. Let the bitchy comments begin... :P\n\nSample Included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a1f0643bf740cc782897b257dc647c33793ddf","amp;dn":"Men+In+Black+III+%282012%29+CAM+READNFO+XviD+AC3-SMiLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a1f0643bf740cc782897b257dc647c33793ddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,161,240,100,59,247,64,204,120,40,151,178,87,220,100,124,51,121,61,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
