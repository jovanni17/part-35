Gets In Your Eyes!\nMr. Lodge's magnificent diamond is protected by state-of-the art booby traps, but they're no match for the C.R.U.S.H. agent Smoke Man, who can vaporize in and out of keyholes. It's up to A.R.C.H.I.E. and J.U.G.H.E.A.D. to stop this condensed C.R.U.S.H. creep.\n\nThanks goes to Jon for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
