In the Case for a Creator, Lee demonstrates beyond a doubt that our universe bears the indelible fingerprints of an intelligent designer. From the incredible fine-tuned variables of the universe, to the nano machines and vast amount of information found in every cell, the proof of design is everywhere. In The Case for Faith, Strobel turns his skills to the most persistent emotional objections to beliefÃ¢â‚¬â€the eight 'heart barriers' to faith. This Gold Medallion-winning book is for those who may be feeling attracted to Jesus but who are faced with difficult questions standing squarely in their path. For Christians, it will deepen their convictions and give them fresh confidence in discussing Christianity with even their most skeptical friends.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible.
