Here it is!\n\n\n-----\n\n\nOriginal airdate:  December 11, 2012\n\n\nEvery year Jack tries to get the family to pose for the perfect holiday card photo and every year his plan fails. So when the kids disappoint him yet again by botching the photo shoot, Tess feels guilty and makes them all swear to stop fighting, as the ultimate Christmas gift for dad. The strain of bottling up their frustration leads to a big fight, and Spencer, afraid his misbehavior will land him on Santa's naughty list, runs away from home. Tess tracks Spencer down at the mall, where the Santa imparts some pretty good wisdom, helping them all enjoy a better holiday season.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30862b0ddc09ce49dd9ed970e5ff95548b7ca310","amp;dn":"Life.With.Boys.S02E02.HDTV.x264-CLDD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30862b0ddc09ce49dd9ed970e5ff95548b7ca310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,134,43,13,220,9,206,73,221,158,217,112,229,255,149,84,139,124,163,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
