Finally got a hold of a copy on eBay and decided to share it with the rest of the world. \n\nI have also scanned the front and back cover and the user manual and included them as images in the torrent.\n\nCD's 1&amp;2 have been ripped in .bin format to preserve audio track's and has been tested use daemon tools to mount.\n\nIf running windows Vista/7 set windows 98/me compatibility mode for best results.\n\n\nHave fun!\n\nP.S seeding this torrent using my Raspberry Pi let me know if you have any problems with download speed. I should be uploading at 5 Mbits/sec.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6518f3f7838a4bb63645ca6c2dd99c0cf1c354","amp;dn":"Outwars+%28PC+1998%29+CD+1%26amp%3B2+Artwork+and+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6518f3f7838a4bb63645ca6c2dd99c0cf1c354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,101,24,243,247,131,138,75,182,54,69,202,108,45,217,156,12,241,195,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
