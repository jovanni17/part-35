The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version). As a result, the tracklisting for Mono Masters differs from Past Masters on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (&quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes. Tracks 9Ã¢â‚¬â€œ12 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7&quot; mono Yellow Submarine EP, but due to poor reception of the full album, the project was abandoned. Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically-produced mono mixdown, or &quot;fold-down&quot;, of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased. &quot;Get Back&quot; (with B-side &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;) was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format. It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo. Thus, the stereo singles included on Past Masters are omitted on this release.\n\nMono Masters Track Listing [320k MP3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_Masters#Mono_Masters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_Masters#Mono_Masters&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbceeedc9aaa4d99a4e4fa4d32f1471c94e613b4","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Mono+Masters+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbceeedc9aaa4d99a4e4fa4d32f1471c94e613b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,206,238,220,154,170,77,153,164,228,250,77,50,241,71,28,148,230,19,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
