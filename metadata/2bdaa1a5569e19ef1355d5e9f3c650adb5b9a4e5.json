It captures its authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intellectual interests at a time when he was retiring from the career of a professional philosopher and was about to become one of the pioneers of the Common Market and the idea of the European Union","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bdaa1a5569e19ef1355d5e9f3c650adb5b9a4e5","amp;dn":"The+Notion+of+Authority+%5BMyeBookShelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bdaa1a5569e19ef1355d5e9f3c650adb5b9a4e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,218,161,165,86,158,25,239,19,85,213,233,243,198,80,173,181,185,164,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
