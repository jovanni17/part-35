AVI's have become obsolete. Good riddance. \n\nHowever, to support these and future downloads I ask YOU KEEP SEEDING after your download is complete. I suggest you set a minimum UL speed of 30 kB/s by right clicking on the torrent in your Bittorrent client and adjusting the Bandwidth Allocation. This will free up my bandwidth for new torrent uploads. THANKS!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI took VIDEO TS files of each concert from their source and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each movie. The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using HandBrake 0.9.4 so they can be played on any current iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.\n===========================================================================\n\nPeter Gabriel: POV (from 1990 LaserDisk)\n\nPOV, executive-produced by Martin Scorsese, is a document of a 1987 concert gig in Athens. It catches Gabriel running through some of his better-known solo numbers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ''Biko,'' ''Solsbury Hill,'' ''Shock the Monkey'' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with a crack band.\n\nRipped from LaserDisc so this is about as clean as you can get. The limitations of the 1987 era video show but it is a very worthwhile look at Peter in the late 80's\n\nTrack list:\n\n- This is the Picture;\n- San Jacinto;\n- Shock the Monkey;\n- Games Without Frontiers;\n- No Self Control;\n- Mercy Street;\n- Sledgehammer;\n- Solsbury Hill;\n- Lay Your Hands on Me;\n- Don't Give Up;\n- In Your Eyes;\n- Biko\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPeter Gabriel - Secret World Live (from the 2003 DVD)\n\nThis film won the 1995 Silver Rose of Montreux award and includes live performances of 'Opening', 'Come Talk To Me', 'Steam', 'Across The River', 'Slow Marimbas', 'Shaking The Tree', 'Blood Of Eden', 'San Jacinto', 'Kiss That Frog', 'Washing Of The Water', 'Solsbury Hill', 'Digging In The Dirt', 'Sledgehammer', 'Secret World', 'Don't Give Up' and 'In Your Eyes'.\n\nThe film received the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.\nThe film starts with Gabriel rising up from the stage in a telephone box singing the opening song. He eventually escapes the box and struggles to reach the circular stage, holding the phone which is on a extending cable, to meet Paula Cole. The two never meet and Gabriel is pulled back to the telephone box.\n\nTrack List\n\nCome Talk To Me\nSteam\nAcross The River\nSlow Marimbas\nShaking The Tree\nBlood Of Eden\nSan Jacinto\nKiss That Frog\nWashing Of The Water\nSolsbury Hill\nDigging In The Dirt\nSledgehammer\nSecret World\nDon't Give Up\nIn Your Eyes\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPeter Gabriel - Growing Up Live (from 2003 DVD)\n\nGrowing Up Live is a concert film by Hamish Hamilton and Peter Gabriel.
