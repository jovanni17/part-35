MPC is pure VBR and is designed to be as transparent as possible. \n\n----------------\n\nWinamp users:\n\nCopy in_mpc.dll to the Winamp plugins folder, then restart Winamp.\n\nMake sure you NEVER have the equalizer on when playing MPC!\nIt will mess up the sound, so make sure it is OFF!\n\n--------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4efb26b948979732224fce9c8b61ba8e6bfc47e8","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+6+Grand+Finale+%5BEAC-MPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4efb26b948979732224fce9c8b61ba8e6bfc47e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,251,38,185,72,151,151,50,34,79,206,156,139,97,186,142,107,252,71,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
