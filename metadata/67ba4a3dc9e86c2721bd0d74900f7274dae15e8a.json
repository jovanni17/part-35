Hot on their heels, however, is a group of loyalists, led by Michael and Gabriel, who are suspicious of Lucifer's true motives. In detective style fashion they slowly start to unmask the true nature of Lucifer's sordid plot. \n\nChronicles of the Host is a fantastic novel of the beginning of all things.
