With 46 releases, you're sure to find something within that brings joy to your heart this coming weekend.  Of course there are 20 singles.  Yes, 20!  That's way more than usual.  What can I say?  I stumbled upon a stash of them earlier this week.  And with Christmas just around the corner, there's also lots and lots of holiday music also included within.\n\nIf I attempt to break this 41st bundle down into genres, for those interested, it would go something like this...\n\nThere would be six Rock to choose from including Aaron Sprinkle, Casting Crowns, Jesse Sprinkle, Mark Tiddy, The Neverclaim, and Steven Curtis Chapman.  We've got two categorized under R&amp;B including Aaron Thomas, and Jennifer Hudson.  If you're looking for Singer-Songwriter, then consider Amos Lee, Gungor, Jamestown Story, Michael Boggs, Mitch Langley, and Repent.  If you're looking for Hip-Hop/Rap rap today, your options are Bakah, Eshon Burgundy, Fog, Frobeats, Jeffrey Alan, and Luke.  As I said earlier, this thing is jammed to the max with Christmas music today including Brandon Heath, Britt Nicole, Building 429, Colton Dixon, Matt Maher, Meredith Andrews, Rhett Walker Band, Sanctus Real, Sidewalk Prophets, Tenth Avenue North, and the latest WoW Christmas release.  Maybe you're looking Pop music?  How about Brett Blondell, Gabi DiPace, Jon McLaughlin, Kari Jobe, Keila Garza, and Mikeschair.  Contemporary music?  Then be sure to check out Dara Maclean, Ohio Avenue, and Shane Harper.  I've even got a rare Reggae release (given that I don't often find much Christian Reggae) today from Hyer Dan.  There are two Praise &amp; Worship albums to choose from including The Relentless Project, and Russell Fragar.  And finally, if Metal/Hardcore is your thing, then you're going to want to get a copy of Seraphim for your collection.\n\nBundle 41 includes the following 46 releases, bringing out total shared for the year up to 1,140 titles...\n\n * Aaron Sprinkle - 2013 - Water And Guns\n * Aaron Thomas - 2013 - People - Single\n * Amos Lee - 2013 - Chill In The Air - Single\n * Bakah - 2013 - The Prelude\n * Brandon Heath - 2013 - In The Bleak Midwinter - Single\n * Brett Blondell - 2013 - Oceans - Where Feet May Fail - Single\n * Britt Nicole - 2013 - O Come All Ye Faithful - Single\n * Building 429 - 2013 - Hark The Herald Angels Sing - Single\n * Casting Crowns - 2013 - All You've Ever Wanted - Single\n * Colton Dixon - 2013 - Jingle Bells - Single\n * Dara Maclean - 2013 - Wanted\n * Eshon Burgundy - 2013 - For God's Sake\n * Fog - 2013 - The End Is The Beginning\n * Frobeats - 2013 - Lecrae - The Drop Remix - Single\n * Gabi DiPace - 2013 - Bring Me Back To Wonder EP\n * Gungor - 2013 - I Am Mountain\n * Hyer Dan - 2013 - 1 Desire\n * Jamestown Story - 2013 - Who I Am - Single\n * Jeffrey Alan - 2013 - Falling\n * Jeffrey Alan - 2013 - No Time To Be Cool\n * Jennifer Hudson - 2013 - I Can't Describe - Single\n * Jesse Sprinkle - 2013 - Digital April, Vol 1\n * Jesse Sprinkle - 2013 - Digital April, Vol 2\n * Jon McLaughlin - 2013 - Holding My Breath\n * Kari Jobe - 2013 - Acoustic Soul - Acoustic Tribute To Kari Jobe\n * Keila Garza - 2013 - Keila Garza EP\n * Luke - 2013 - For His Glory\n * Mark Tiddy - 2013 - The Bank Holiday EP\n * Matt Maher - 2013 - O Come O Come Emmanuel - Single\n * Meredith Andrews - 2013 - Behold The Savior EP\n * Michael Boggs - 2013 - More Like A Lion EP\n * Mikeschair - 2013 - This Is Our Moment - Single\n * Mitch Langley - 2013 - Grace Defines Me - Single\n * Neverclaim, The - 2013 - The Neverclaim\n * Ohio Avenue - 2013 - What Tomorrow Holds - Single\n * Relentless Project, The - 2013 - Live Acoustic EP\n * Repent - 2013 - Desire - Single\n * Rhett Walker Band - 2013 - Silver Bells - Single\n * Russell Fragar - 2013 - Worship Now\n * Sanctus Real - 2013 - Angels We Have Heard On High - Single\n * Seraphim - 2013 - Roots And Ruins\n * Shane Harper - 2013 - Hold You Up - Single\n * Sidewalk Prophets - 2013 - Merry Christmas To You\n * Steven Curtis Chapman - 2013 - The Glorious Unfolding\n * Tenth Avenue North - 2013 - We Three Kings - Single\n * WoW Christmas - 2013 - WoW Christmas 2013\n\nBe Blessed,\nTorrentTracts - September 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e738e26bcc1b57b51bb93114698ec9b2973f9cf6","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+41%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e738e26bcc1b57b51bb93114698ec9b2973f9cf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,56,226,107,204,27,87,181,27,185,49,20,105,142,201,178,151,63,156,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
