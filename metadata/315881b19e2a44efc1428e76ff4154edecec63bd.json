(You only need one of these methods).\n\nGame Type:     Strategy &gt; Breeding/Constructing. \n               A hybrid realtime/turnbased strategy game.\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\nGame Image Was tested and works normal.\n\nCompressed with Winrar.\n\nAwesome game I think (even though its in japanese still..), This is a straight rip from the original retail game disc which I bought myself.  Hope everyone enjoys it!\n\nOnly downside is if you don't understand Japanese well good luck..I couldn't find any walkthru's for it, no english tranlation patch's are out for this game yet, don't know if there ever will be but I hope.\n\nGame Description:\n\nIts the year 2037 the ministry of defence created special duty 4 also known as secret elite unit who operates independantly to destroy insurgents, terrorists, or any other threat, and they only answer directly to the president. They use the best state of the art equipment.\n\n\nRecommended to burn with Alcohol 120% (Included in Download) Set datatype to Playstation When burning Image To CD-R if possible.\n\nBest Recommended CD-R Media to burn Ps1 games on are Taiyo Yuden, Verbatim Datalife Plus, TDK Reflex, HP CD-R discs are good to.\n(Verbatim or standard TDk should work). \n\nUr Best bet is probably Verbatim discs for psx backups or even ps2 backups. They will almost always work if you burn it right with Alcohol 120% or Dvd Decrypter for ps2 dvd games. (This is also assuming your consoles are modded or have another method of loading backups correctly).\n\nPlease Remember to Seed This.\n\nAny Problems or questions, just post a comment.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nYou guys and anyone else downloading this need to seed don't just leech, I can't seed all the time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:315881b19e2a44efc1428e76ff4154edecec63bd","amp;dn":"%5BPsx%5D+%5BNtsc-J%5D+CRW%3A+Counter+Revolution+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"315881b19e2a44efc1428e76ff4154edecec63bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,88,129,177,158,42,68,239,193,66,142,118,255,65,84,237,236,236,99,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
