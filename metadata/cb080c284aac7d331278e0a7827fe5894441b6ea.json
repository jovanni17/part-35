Familiarity with the fundamental chemistry and physics of this transition is essential for students in chemistry and materials science through academic and industry researchers working on sol-gel-related applications. The book features a didactic approach, using simple and clear language to explain the sol to gel transition and the accompanying processes. The text is also suitable for use in short courses and workshops for graduate students as well as professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb080c284aac7d331278e0a7827fe5894441b6ea","amp;dn":"The+Sol+to+Gel+Transition+-+Plinio+Innocenzi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb080c284aac7d331278e0a7827fe5894441b6ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,8,12,40,74,172,125,51,18,120,224,167,130,127,229,137,68,65,182,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
