I have split all of the files into individual chapters, which I think most people would agree is a better format.\n\nThere are two versions of the complete and unabridged audiobook in this torrent. You can choose the mp3 version (each chapter is a single file, 24 files in total), or you can choose the fully chapterized m4b (iPod/iPhone or similar device) version (2 fully chapterized files, already tagged for iTunes). Both versions are at 128 kbps.\n\nAlso included in the torrent is a PDF companion ebook with all of the book's original appendices along with illustrations &amp; maps (which I made myself, thanks to Amazon's &quot;Look Inside&quot; feature).\n\nEnjoy and please seed!   \n\n\n\nConquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stand of the Aztecs\nby Buddy Levy; read by Patrick Lawlor\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2008 Tantor Media\nUnabridged (Length: 12 hrs., 14 mins.)\nOrig.

There is probably no new information on the conquest left to uncover, but it is a thrilling, moving, and tragic story well worth retelling. Levy is not a professional historian, but he is a fine writer who knows the material, and he is wise enough to allow the pure excitement and drama of the story to unfold naturally. At the center of the tale, of course, are the two protagonists. CortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s is viewed as an intriguing combination of ruthless ambition, religious piety, and surprising tenderness. Montezuma, also deeply religious, was less a man of action than CortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, and his contemplative nature probably sealed his doom. As Levy illustrates, this was also an earthshaking clash of civilizations that is still working itself out five centuries later. This is a superb work of popular history, ideal for general readers.\n\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR . . .\n\nBuddy Levy is the author of Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stand of the Aztecs (Bantam Dell, 2008); American Legend: The Real-Life Adventures of David Crockett (Putnam, 2005, Berkley Books, 2006); and Echoes On Rimrock: In Pursuit of the Chukar Partridge (Pruett, 1998).
