Founded in 1989, over the course of six albums (three in the US), Nekromantix have inspired a generation of rockabilly and psychobilly bands, earned a Grammy nod, and spawned the immensely popular side project Horrorpops, who have scanned over 80,000 CDs in their own right. Now comes Life Is A Grave And I Dig It!!!, a return to the raw, driving sound of early classics like Return of the Loving Dead. Anchored by leader Kim Nekroman&amp;#039;s thumping upright bass, Life Is A Grave And I Dig It!!perfectly delivers on Alternative Press&amp;#039; description of the band as &quot;a 1950s date with Motorhead.&quot; With a headlining national tour out of the box - the 2007 incarnation of the wildly successful Hellcat tour - and a world-wide following from extensive touring in Japan, the US, and Europe, Nekromantix will continue to lead the pack, all the way to the boneyard!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff0d3687272fe7619c887f5dc00da9b6969d6b0e","amp;dn":"Nekromantix+-+Life+Is+A+Grave+%26+I+Dig+IT%21+%28Advance%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff0d3687272fe7619c887f5dc00da9b6969d6b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,13,54,135,39,47,231,97,156,136,127,93,192,13,169,182,150,157,107,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
