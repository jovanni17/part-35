Over the years, the band has evolved through line-up changes and a constantly developing sound, progressing from a primitive sound to embracing many different influences, while still maintaining a rugged and uncompromising vision.\nImmediately, what stands out about Black September, particularly on this album, are three things. First, the guitars just have a great tone to them that are atmospheric despite a clear production. Second, the songs are just very catchy and well written with a nice mix of tempos, riffs, and a few all out blasts. Third, female vocalist Jen PickettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivery has a brutal edge that will undoubtedly garner comparisons to Angela Gossow, a good thing in my estimation.\n\nBlack September At MySpace\n\n\n\n\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tBlackened Death Metal\nBitrate:\t192 k\nSize:\t49.66 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n7 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:166c6dd7416a946e70ba33ed634ddf05123d4ecc","amp;dn":"Black+September+-++The+Forbidden+Gates+Beyond++2010+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"166c6dd7416a946e70ba33ed634ddf05123d4ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,108,109,215,65,106,148,110,112,186,51,237,99,77,223,5,18,61,78,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
