The best track was the most unusual, when Philip Oakey took a backseat and let one of his fellow vocalists -- probably Joanne Catherall, though her singing is interchangeable with Susanne Sulley's -- handle a delicately arranged love song, &quot;One Man in My Heart.&quot; But more typical was the song that followed it, &quot;Words,&quot; in which Oakey whined at considerable length about undetailed wrongs done to him in childhood. Even with a good dance beat, such stuff was hard to stomach, and most of the blips and blats that filled up the tracks had been used to better purpose on earlier recordings.
