Why is it called that? Well . . .\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGeneric.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ GURPS starts with simple rules, and builds up to as much optional detail as you like. This abridged version presents the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcore rulesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that most\nGMs start with.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUniversal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The basic rule system is designed to emphasize realism. Therefore, it can fit any situation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ fantasy or historical, past, present, or future.\n   \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRolePlaying.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This is not just a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhack-and-slashÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ game. The rules are written to make true roleplaying possible ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and to encourage it. GURPS is a game in\nwhich you take on the persona of another character ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and pretend, for a little while, to be that character.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSystem.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Over 160 different books have been published for GURPS, in eight different languages (so far). It is one of the recognized standards for role-\nplaying, worldwide.\n\nAbout GURPS Lite\n\nThis is the boiled-down ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œessenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of GURPS: all the fundamental rules, but not the options and embellishments that often confuse new players. Once youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re comfortable with these rules, you can pick up the GURPS Basic Set and jump right into the action.\n\nExperienced Game Masters will, we hope, find this a valuable tool for introducing new players to the game.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e93356ac7e70f58b63e4c6c1e4e83f1c6f547c7","amp;dn":"gurpslit.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e93356ac7e70f58b63e4c6c1e4e83f1c6f547c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,147,53,106,199,231,15,88,182,62,76,108,30,78,131,241,198,245,71,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
