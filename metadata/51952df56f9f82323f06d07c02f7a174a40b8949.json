Jasmine (11:14)\n02. Skin As Soft As Moonlight (09:38)\n\nAbout:\n&quot;Jasmine&quot; was a track written after the &quot;Shringara&quot; sessions, in 1999. I listen to a lot of pysch-rock like The Doors, Opal, and Mazzy Star, and this track was an attempt to take the Makyo sound in a bit more in that direction, hence all the guitars. I'm still not sure how I did the tabla sampling on this one, sounds like it was played! This was originally intended to be the lead-off track on the Sky Dancing 1 comp, but &quot;Tantrika&quot; wound up there instead ... &quot;Jasmine&quot; was eventually released on a comp on the Celestial Dragon label in Hong Kong, but it's been out of print forever. So here it is, re-mastered.\n\n&quot;Skin As Soft As Moonlight&quot; was also produced in the period between &quot;Shringara&quot; and &quot;Yakshini&quot; and was written for my friends at Interchill Records, where it appeared on their &quot;Interior Horizons&quot; comp. This one's me wondering what Popul Vuh would sound like with Bill Laswell producing ;-)\n\nreleased 11 November 2014\n\nWritten and produced by Gio Makyo.\n\n&quot;Jasmine&quot; : vocals by Keiku","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51952df56f9f82323f06d07c02f7a174a40b8949","amp;dn":"Makyo+-+Jasmine+EP+%282014%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51952df56f9f82323f06d07c02f7a174a40b8949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,149,45,245,111,159,130,50,63,6,208,124,2,247,161,116,164,11,137,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
