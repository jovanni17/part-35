For the May 1971 session Elvis had even used folk group The Nashville Edition as backing singers and selected some interesting songs to record.\n\n However, from a marketing perspective we can hardly see an LP called Elvis Folk appealing to his fans in 1971, and letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face it Elvis wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recording what the general public would consider Folk. Instead the sound was more of a spontaneous Ã¢â‚¬Å“unplugged acousticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feel as opposed to the more recent big ballads or soulful stew of the Memphis sessions. But stillÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ some call it folk.\n\n \nEnjoy1\njeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c7f2223a188517cafe6e0b4912a35a37d2884c","amp;dn":"Elvis+presley+-+Some+call+it+folk+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c7f2223a188517cafe6e0b4912a35a37d2884c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,199,242,34,58,24,133,23,202,254,110,11,73,18,163,90,55,210,136,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
