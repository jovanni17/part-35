He needs no mechanical devices to travel the Universe. He does it at THE SPEED OF THOUGHT. BÃ‡â‚¬\n\nDescription:\nA Question of Origins (with Dutch subtitles):\nDuring the last century, many globally accepted evolution as fact. However, recent discoveries in almost every area of ??science speak of these molecules-to-man theory against. Search for the origin of life takes you on an inspiring journey through science and Scripture in the search for the beginning of humanity. The theory of evolution has been applied to most areas of science, and this DVD examines the latest discoveries in the field of cosmology, chemistry and biology. Confirms the observable evidence evolution? Or does the evolutionary bias many blinded to the overwhelming data that point to an awesome Creator? Understanding the true origin of man is essential in determining one's destination. This visually rich production shows were convincing evidence that the universe and all life created. Moreover reveals scientific knowledge, which is only found in the Bible, the God of the Bible is the Creator. Seeing Quest for the origin of life is essential when someone questions or doubts concerning the scientific accuracy of the Word of God. Is our solar system created by the Big Bang? Can chemical compounds spontaneously evolve into life? Evolution explains the variety of life on earth?\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
