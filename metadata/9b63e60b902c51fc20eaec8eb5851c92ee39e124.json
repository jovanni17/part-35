I think it's possible there were multiple sessions in which the best versions were added to the DVD since they're out of order on the DVD from what was performed on the AXS show. \n\nThis may have been the complete song list when taking a look at the BluRay release.\n\nStand Back\nEnchanted *\nIf Anyone Falls in Love *\nRhiannon\nCrash Into Me\nDreams *\nSorcerer\nThe One *\nGold Dust Woman\nI Need to Know *\nCircle Dance *\nLandside *\nSara *\nFall From Grace\nHow Still My Love\nEdge of Seventeen *\nRock &amp; Roll\n\n* Missing from this aired performance on AXS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b63e60b902c51fc20eaec8eb5851c92ee39e124","amp;dn":"Stevie+Nicks+-+2007-Oct+-+Soundstage+Sessions+in+Chicago%2C+IL+++A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b63e60b902c51fc20eaec8eb5851c92ee39e124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,99,230,11,144,44,81,252,32,234,236,142,181,133,28,146,238,57,225,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
