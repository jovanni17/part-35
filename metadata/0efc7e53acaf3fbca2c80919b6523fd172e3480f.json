But, all too often, this transition is being made with reckless disregard for security. If Ajax applications arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t designed and coded properly, they can be susceptible to far more dangerous security vulnerabilities than conventional Web or desktop software. Ajax developers desperately need guidance on securing their applications: knowledge thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been virtually impossible to find, until now.\n            \nAjax Security systematically debunks todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most dangerous myths about Ajax security, illustrating key points with detailed case studies of actual exploited Ajax vulnerabilities, ranging from MySpaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Samy worm to MacWorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conference code validator. Even more important, it delivers specific, up-to-the-minute recommendations for securing Ajax applications in each major Web programming language and environment, including .NET, Java, PHP, and even Ruby on Rails. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to:\n \nÃ‚Â·       \nMitigate unique risks associated with Ajax, including overly granular Web services, application control flow tampering, and manipulation of program logic.\n\nWrite new Ajax code more safelyÃ¢â‚¬â€and identify and fix flaws in existing code.\nÃ‚Â·        \nPrevent emerging Ajax-specific attacks, including JavaScript hijacking and persistent storage theft.\nÃ‚Â·        \nAvoid attacks based on XSS and SQL InjectionÃ¢â‚¬â€including a dangerous SQL Injection variant that can extract an entire backend database with just two requests.\nÃ‚Â·        \nLeverage security built into Ajax frameworks like Prototype, Dojo, and ASP.NET AJAX ExtensionsÃ¢â‚¬â€and recognize what you still must implement on your own.\nÃ‚Â·        \nCreate more secure Ã¢â‚¬Å“mashupÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ applications.\n \nAjax Security will be an indispensable resource for developers coding or maintaining Ajax applications; architects and development managers planning or designing new Ajax software, and all software security professionals, from QA specialists to penetration testers.\n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0efc7e53acaf3fbca2c80919b6523fd172e3480f","amp;dn":"Ajax+Security","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0efc7e53acaf3fbca2c80919b6523fd172e3480f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,252,126,83,172,175,63,188,162,200,9,25,182,82,63,209,114,227,72,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
