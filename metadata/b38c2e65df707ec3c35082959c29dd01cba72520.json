The test does not have a finish, although it loops through the ram checking over and over for bad address spaces. \n\nPersonally after one hour if Memtest hasn't found a bad sector in your ram, your ram is good!\n\n\nHOW TO USE\n----------------------------------------\nBurn to an image, and boot to the cd from any computer you think the ram is bad and want to test with. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=========================================\n\nG U R U F U E L \n           .com\n\nHARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PROGRAMMING, HACKING.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38c2e65df707ec3c35082959c29dd01cba72520","amp;dn":"Memtest+x86+v4.0+%5B2010%5D+-+%5BGuruFuel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b38c2e65df707ec3c35082959c29dd01cba72520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,140,46,101,223,112,126,195,195,80,130,149,156,41,221,1,203,167,37,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
