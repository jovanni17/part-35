Even then, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really have to. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to change the outcome or anything.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThose are the words of Calvin Matthew Stringel, better known as Mechani-Cal. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sarcastic, down on his luck armored villain. Follow his exploits as he gets swept up in a world domination scheme gone wrong and ends up working for this weak willed, mercy loving heroes. Immerse yourself in his epic battles and see what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like to be an outsider looking in at a world that few have ever experienced.\n\nClimb into CalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s battlesuit and join him on his journey. Will he avoid selling out his principles for a paycheck and a pardon? Can he resist the camaraderie of being on a super team? Does he fall prey to the ample charms of the beautiful Olympian Aphrodite? How will he survive the jealous schemes of Ultraweapon, who wears armor so powerful it makes CalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s look like a museum piece?\n\nSee the world of Ã¢â‚¬Å“righteous do-gooders&quot; through the eyes of someone who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t particularly care for them.\n\nAnd remember - Losing an argument with a group of rioters isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a good excuse to start lobbing tear gas indiscriminately at them. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve only got so many rounds and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to be a long day, so make sure you get as many as possible with each one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bff35c30d204ac2395647a12b24e975ef04f0180","amp;dn":"Confessions+of+a+D-List+Supervillain+%28epub%2C+mobi%2C+html%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bff35c30d204ac2395647a12b24e975ef04f0180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,243,92,48,210,4,172,35,149,100,122,18,178,78,151,94,240,79,1,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
