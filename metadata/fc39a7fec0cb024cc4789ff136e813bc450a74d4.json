Being\nversed in a wide amount of music, Huismans is philosophical\nwhen questioned on how he came across his distinctive,\nearth-shattering style:\n\n&quot;I didn&amp;#039;t want to jump someone else&amp;#039;s train, but I figured if\nI bring my own musical background and preferences into play, I\nwould come up with different music anyway. That&amp;#039;s what I\nusually do really; absorb and process elements from all kinds\nof music I love and fuse them into something I feel\ncomfortable calling my own.&quot;\n\nHuisman&amp;#039;s previous incarnations have included the dubbed out\nbroken-beat of Dogdaze on the Flying High label and more\nrecently as A Made Up Sound Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹ making serious moves in techno\non ShedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£s Hardwax affiliated Subsolo imprint.\n\nIf 2007 was a year for Burial and Pinch, then summer 2008\nsurely has 2562 written all over it. &amp;#039;Aerial&amp;#039; is the fourth CD\nrelease on a label that has yet to put a foot wrong, from an\nartist set to realize his potential with this brilliant album\nsurely destined for great things.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc39a7fec0cb024cc4789ff136e813bc450a74d4","amp;dn":"2562+-+Aerial+%28Retail%29+2008+DV8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc39a7fec0cb024cc4789ff136e813bc450a74d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,57,167,254,192,203,2,76,196,120,159,241,54,232,19,188,69,10,116,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
