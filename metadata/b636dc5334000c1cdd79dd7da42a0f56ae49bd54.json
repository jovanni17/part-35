Hand in hand with this David and Goliath legal battle is the tender love story of Koiki and Bonita, the woman he met as a teenager, and loved through thirty years of marriage and the raising of ten children. It tells of the deep love and partnership that fuelled their fight for Australian law to recognise traditional land rights. Although Koiki never lived to hear the High Courts decision that returned his land to him, the name Mabo has become known nationwide. \n\nGenre: Biography | Drama \nIMDB rating: 6.6/10 from 79 users \nDirected by: Rachel Perkins \nStarring: Jimi Bani, Deborah Mailman and Ewen Leslie \n\nRelease Name: Mabo.2012.DVDRip.XviD-aAF \nSize: 1.4 GB \nVideo: XViD | 624 x 352 | 1619 Kbps \nAudio: English | AC3 | 256 Kbps \nRuntime: 103 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b636dc5334000c1cdd79dd7da42a0f56ae49bd54","amp;dn":"Mabo+2012+DVDRip+XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b636dc5334000c1cdd79dd7da42a0f56ae49bd54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,54,220,83,52,0,12,28,221,121,221,125,164,42,15,86,174,73,189,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
