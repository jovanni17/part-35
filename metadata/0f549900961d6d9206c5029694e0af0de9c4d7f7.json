The Mighty Clouds of Joy were formed in Los Angeles during the mid-'50s by schoolmates Joe Ligon and Johnny Martin; while still in their teens, the original group ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which also included brothers Ermant and Elmo Franklin, Leon Polk and Richard Wallace ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ made their recorded debut in 1960 with &quot;Steal Away to Jesus,&quot; cut for the Peacock label. Their debut LP Family Circle arrived a year later. In the years that followed, the Mighty Clouds earned a reputation among gospel's greatest showmen; one of the first groups to incorporate choreographed moves into their act, their nimble footwork and bright, color-coordinated outfits earned them the sobriquet &quot;The Temptations of Gospel.&quot; More importantly, they were the first group to add bass, drums and keyboards to the standard quartet accompaniment of solo guitar, resulting in a sound which horrified traditionalists but appealed to younger listeners ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ so much so, in fact, that the Mighty Clouds became the first gospel act ever to appear on television's Soul Train, where they performed their disco smash &quot;Mighty High.&quot; Their crossover success continued with opening slots for secular pop stars including Marvin Gaye, the Rolling Stones and Paul Simon, whom the group backed during a month-long stint at Madison Square Garden. While lineup changes plagued the Mighty Clouds throughout their career, they remained active through the 1990s; in addition to co-founders Ligon and Wallace, their latter-day incarnation also included Michael McCowin, Wilbert Williams, Johnny Valentine and Ron Staples.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f549900961d6d9206c5029694e0af0de9c4d7f7","amp;dn":"Mighty+Clouds+of+Joy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f549900961d6d9206c5029694e0af0de9c4d7f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,84,153,0,150,29,109,146,6,197,2,150,148,224,175,13,233,196,215,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
