Then, out of the years of the Industrial Revolution, came the horse buses and the steam cars, awesome contraptions which rolled along with the noise of twenty sledge hammers in full play, and which were to change our whole attitude to travel. More than 200 photographs and engravings collected from all over the world include rare and historical pictures. There are 24 pages of lively colour with pictures of buses, trams and streetcars","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac7b9bfd0a4a5f0c4fef741fc19ba7384c25cd23","amp;dn":"Buses%2C+Trolleys+%26amp%3B+Trams.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac7b9bfd0a4a5f0c4fef741fc19ba7384c25cd23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,123,155,253,10,74,95,12,79,239,116,31,193,155,167,56,76,37,205,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
