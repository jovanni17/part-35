And while we were sitting there           \n         a whole big bunch of bunny rabbits came hopping             \n         out looking to all the world like they were gonna           \n         have a meeting or convention or something. About            \n         that time a great big dog showed up on the scene,           \n         he saw the rabbits he started barking like mad.             \n         The rabbits of course dissapeared in a flash.               \n         Cheryl and I thought it might be fun to make up             \n         a story about what had just happened, and from              \n         that notion came 'The Tale of the Bunny Picnic'.            \n         And this tale starts with a phrase like many other          \n         good stories, &quot;Once upon a time...&quot;                         \n                                                                     \n           This developed into the universe presented here,          \n         with Bean Bunny as the protagonist, a character             \n         which would later appear in The Jim Henson Hour             \n         and Muppet*Vision 3D. Bean was performed by Steve           \n         Whitmire, previously known primarily for his work           \n         on Fraggle Rock (Wembley Fraggle and Sprocket),             \n         who would later go on to take over many of Jim's            \n         characters after his passing (including, perhaps            \n         most importantly, Kermit).                                  \n                                      Enjoy!                         \n                                                                     \n                                               \n                                             \n                                               \n                    \n                \n                         \n                               \n                                               \n                                                                     \n                              ~HO HO HO~                             \n                                                                    \n                                                              \n                 For the month of December we've decided to     \n                do something special.
