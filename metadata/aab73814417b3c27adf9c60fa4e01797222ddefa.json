That style is emo hardcore, as the band thrashes in a sub-metal mode while the adenoidal singers whine about how disappointing things are and how they don't feel they fit in. (&quot;Galena&quot;: &quot;I don't belong here&quot;; &quot;Echo&quot;: &quot;The world that I know never had a care for me.&quot;) It's a style thoroughly investigated by the likes of Death Cab for Cutie, Taking Back Sunday, and Yellowcard, among others. But all those bands had their breakouts in the mid-2000s, and Balance &amp; Composure is coming along half-a-dozen years later, which is too late to join the pack and too soon for a revival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aab73814417b3c27adf9c60fa4e01797222ddefa","amp;dn":"Balance+and+Composure+-+Discography+%282009-2013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aab73814417b3c27adf9c60fa4e01797222ddefa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,183,56,20,65,123,60,39,173,249,198,15,164,224,23,151,34,45,222,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
