One Minute Science proves an unlikely alchemy of hard-driving metal; electronic noise; and rootsy, careful vocals. This album seethes with testosterone-driven intensity. While Sunna seem to derive influence from everyone from Soundgarden to Nine Inch Nails to Ben Harper, no single sound prevails. You&amp;#039;ll find yourself headbanging with &quot;Power Struggle&quot; one moment (&quot;I will survive &amp;#039;cause I want more and I will create a bigger war... I will defeat you&quot;) and crooning along on &quot;Forlorn&quot; the next (&quot;Do I live in my dream forlorn? If you join me there, together we have home&quot;). While each song on One Minute Science stylistically defies the one that precedes it, they all thematically meld. The result is an album that is taut, dark, and compelling.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bd81907a5825d12ab6058312424a6ce9e1506e8","amp;dn":"Sunna+-+One+Minute+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bd81907a5825d12ab6058312424a6ce9e1506e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,216,25,7,165,130,93,18,171,96,88,49,36,36,166,206,158,21,6,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
