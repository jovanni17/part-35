Specifically, this means that I intend to explain how the CLR works and\nthe facilities that it offers. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also discuss various parts of the Framework Class Library (FCL).\nNo book could fully explain the FCLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it contains literally thousands of types now, and this\nnumber continues to grow at an alarming rate. Therefore, here IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m concentrating on the core\ntypes that every developer needs to be aware of. And while this book isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t specifically about\nWindows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Silverlight, XML Web services,\nWeb Forms, and so on, the technologies presented in the book are applicable to all these\napplication types.\nThe book addresses Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, .NET Framework version 4.0, and version 4.0\nof the C# programming language. Since Microsoft tries to maintain a large degree of backward\ncompatibility when releasing a new version of these technologies, many of the things\nI discuss in this book apply to earlier versions as well. All the code samples use the C#\nprogramming language as a way to demonstrate the behavior of the various facilities. But,\nsince the CLR is usable by many programming languages, the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s content is still quite\napplicable for the non-C# programmer.\nToday, Microsoft offers several versions of the CLR. There is the desktop/server version, which\nruns on 32-bit x86 versions of Microsoft Windows as well as 64-bit x64 and IA64 versions\nof Windows. There is the Silverlight version, which is produced from the same source code\nbase as the desktop/server version of the .NET FrameworkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CLR. Therefore, everything in this\nbook applies to building Silverlight applications, with the exception of some differences in\nhow Silverlight loads assemblies. There is also a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œliteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ version of the .NET Framework called\nthe .NET Compact Framework, which is available for Windows Mobile phones and other\ndevices running the Windows CE operating system. Much of the information presented in\nthis book is applicable to developing applications for the .NET Compact Framework, but this\nplatform is not the primary focus of this book.\nOn December 13, 2001, ECMA International (http://www.ecma-international.org/ ) accepted\nthe C# programming language, portions of the CLR, and portions of the FCL as standards.\nThe standards documents that resulted from this have allowed other organizations to build\nECMA-compliant versions of these technologies for other CPU architectures, as well as other\noperating systems. In fact, Novell produces Moonlight (http://www.mono-project.com\n/Moonlight), an open-source implementation of Silverlight (http://Silverlight.net) that is\nprimarily for Linux and other UNIX/X11-based operating systems. Moonlight is based on the\nECMA specifications. Much of the content in this book is about these standards; therefore,\nmany will find this book useful for working with any runtime/library implementation that adheres\nto the ECMA standard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d33c12c8b3f0fbeeb15cd0fa19b26a87f96477b9","amp;dn":"CLR+via+C%23+3rd+Ed+Jeffery+Richter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d33c12c8b3f0fbeeb15cd0fa19b26a87f96477b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,60,18,200,179,240,251,238,177,92,208,250,25,178,106,135,249,100,119,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
