Install game\n\n\nTired about all the self-made CD/DVD images made from download versions of\nthe games? Our games are made from physical sources if possible - like in\nthe good old times and how we think it should still be done. In our opinion\ndigital download versions should be tagged as such or at least it should be\nnoted in the nfo. Also we think that physical sources never could be dupes\nof digital versions as well as CD versions are no dupes of DVD ones. All\nold and still active scene rules proof that we are right (the new S.I.R\nrules from 2009 and 2010 are not signed by any scene group and are not\nactive because of that).\n\nAlso keep in mind that digital download games below 350mb in size belong\ninto 0day section and not into gameiso. We have seen digital download games\nthat are some gigabytes in size in the 0day section. So please make the\nright decision.\n\nWe bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us\nor hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care\nbecause we think that scene means that every game should be released.\n\nTo rise the quality of our releases we now try to make all our releases\nboth in normal image format (bin/cue or iso) as requested by the scene\nrules and also in clone (Alcohol 120%) format.\n\n\n    0x0815 - 0x0007 - FLT - GENESiS - GREENPEACE - PROPHET - POSTMORTEM\n                        Razor1911 - RELOADED - VACE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9cd23be9c738bd8828b330179f2343a5db79a7","amp;dn":"The.Scruffs-FASiSO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9cd23be9c738bd8828b330179f2343a5db79a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,156,210,59,233,199,56,189,136,40,179,48,23,159,35,67,165,219,121,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
