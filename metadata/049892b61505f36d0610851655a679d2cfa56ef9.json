Let's just face\nit and instead of dwelling on the loss, focus on the new\npower we as artists have, to target and reach our audiences\ndirectly.\nHonestly I don't care about the &quot;music industry&quot;.\nI care about music.\nMusic is communication.\nLet's try to get back to the main reason musicians really\nmake music.\nTo be heard, no?\nIt's my personal reason anyway.\nSo I am quite bluntly pirating The Pirate Bay.\nChoosing for myself.\nI guess you could say,\nI'm the pirate.\n\nAll my love,\n\nSoso&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://youcancallmesoso.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://youcancallmesoso.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFree DIY album from this Swedish act.
