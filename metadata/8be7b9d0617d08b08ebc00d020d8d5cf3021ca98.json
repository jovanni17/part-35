Devin Powers produced the album and played most of the instruments, and he's given Shocked an engaging set of tracks to work with, from the light R&amp;B of &quot;Liquid Prayer&quot; and the sassy dance-friendly pop of &quot;Paperboy&quot; to the gentle contemporary folk feel of &quot;Other People&quot; and the full-on rock of &quot;Giant Killer.&quot; The sound of the album fits this batch of songs, which for the most part are more playful than one might expect from Shocked, especially the sly and sexy &quot;Paperboy&quot; and the plainspoken affirmations of love in &quot;Waterproof&quot; and &quot;Love's Song.&quot; Shocked is in fine voice here, and she seems to be having a lot of fun making like a pop diva or a rock &amp; roll belter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8be7b9d0617d08b08ebc00d020d8d5cf3021ca98","amp;dn":"Michelle+Shocked+-+Soul+of+My+Soul+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8be7b9d0617d08b08ebc00d020d8d5cf3021ca98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,231,185,208,97,125,8,176,142,188,0,208,32,216,213,207,48,33,202,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
