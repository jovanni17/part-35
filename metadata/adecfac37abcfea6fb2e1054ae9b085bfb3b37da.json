In an effort to rule over the Dark World alone, Jedah wants to save all of the dispirited souls. To create his perfect salvation, he calls those with valuable souls to his world so can take control of them. Choose from 18 horror themed characters as they battle in a tournament to the death. Every character has unique combinations and ultra powerful dark force moves. Be warned, though, as the arenas can have positive and negative effects on the fighters. You'll be mesmerized by the gorgeous, hand drawn animation that brings the action to life. After beating the computer controlled contenders, challenge your friends in the versus mode, and if they fear your superior skills, feel free to handicap the match. Darkstalkers 3 will challenge your skills as you fight to become the ruler of the night.\nRelease Date: November 18, 1998\nMSRP: 28.9 USD\nT for Teen: Animated Blood, Animated Violence\nGenre: Fighting\nPublisher: Capcom\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\n*Based on the arcade game.\n*18 horror-themed characters.\n*Each character has a unique fighting style.\n*Arenas affect each character.\n*Hand-drawn animation.\n*Variety of gameplay modes.\n\n\nGame Details\nMedia: 1 x CD-R\nRegion: NTSC-U\nLanguages: English Only\nPlayers: 1-2\nGame Altered: No\nOther Info: SLUS-00745 \nNo 50/60Hz selector but does have X,Y screen adjustment option\n\nFile Details\nFormat: .bin/.cue\nUnpacked size:715 MB (749.838.881 bytes)\nTested and working epsxe 1.9.0 \n\nInstructions\n1.
