Kids &amp; adults just love it!\n\nLegendary rodeo star Smokey Banks (Michael Biehn) has been riding bulls all of his life. He's been to the top and now he's hit rock bottom after a run in with the law. Smokey's faced with two choices: jail or volunteering to teach a Christian boy named Danny (Brock Pierce) how to ride a bull. If it was easy, Smokey would be OK with it.
