Also problems should be fixed with this torrent it's no longer rar and is no longer upscaled. Also the 1st sonic boom upload was my first TV show/video upload so you can understand why there may have been some problems.\n\nEpisode 3 Translate:\nTails builds a translator robot with the unintentional ability to read minds. His friends are not impressed.\n\nEpisode 4 Buster:\nWhen Sticks' friends tell her to be nicer to (non-anthropomorphic) animals, she becomes attached to a slime-belching robot dog named Buster.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Boom_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Boom_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4657237c1bd7f182ab411efdf4d07df7e301e1d9","amp;dn":"Sonic+Boom+Episodes+3-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4657237c1bd7f182ab411efdf4d07df7e301e1d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,87,35,124,27,215,241,130,171,65,30,253,244,208,125,247,227,1,225,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
