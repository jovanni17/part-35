After the Bossmen disbanded -- bassist Mark Farner later went on to form Grand Funk Railroad -- Wagner founded the Frost with guitarist Don Hartman, bassist Jack Smolinski and drummer Bob Riggs; after exchanging Smolinski for Gordy Garris, the group debuted in 1968 with the single &quot;Bad Girl,&quot; and upon signing to Vanguard they issued their 1969 debut LP Frost Music, scoring a regional smash with the single &quot;Mystery Man.&quot; Rock and Roll Music, recorded live at Detroit's famed Grande Ballroom, followed later that same year, but despite earning a cult following throughout the midwest the Frost failured to capture a national audience, and in the wake of 1970's Through the Eyes of Love the group disbanded. Wagner later went on to considerable success as a session guitarist, working with artists including Lou Reed, Alice Cooper and Peter Gabriel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11a6860ca92bb89bfca77651bb1e6a40cc2e27ea","amp;dn":"The+Frost+-+Studio+Discography+%281969-70%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11a6860ca92bb89bfca77651bb1e6a40cc2e27ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,166,134,12,169,43,184,155,252,167,118,81,187,30,106,64,204,46,39,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
