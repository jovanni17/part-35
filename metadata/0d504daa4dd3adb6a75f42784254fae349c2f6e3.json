James Joseph McGuinn was born on July 13, 1942, in Chicago, where by his teenage years he was already something of a folk music prodigy. After touring with the Limelighters, in 1960 he signed on as an accompanist with the Chad Mitchell Trio, appearing on the LPs Mighty Day on Campus and At the Bitter End; frustrated with his limited role in the group, he soon joined Bobby Darin's group when the singer moved from pop to folk. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.95%\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia/Legacy\nCatalog:\t\tCK 47494\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.I'm So Restless\n02.My New Woman\n03.Draggin'\n04.The Water Is Wide\n05.Same Old Sound\n06.Bag Full Of Money\n07.Gate Of Horn\n08.Peace On You\n09.Lover Of The Bayou\n10.Stone (The Lord Loves A Rolling Stone)\n11.Lisa\n12.Take Me Away\n13.Jolly Roger\n14.Friend\n15.Dreamland\n16.Dixie Highway\n17.American Girl\n18.Up To Me\n19.Russian Hill\n20.Born To Rock And Roll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d504daa4dd3adb6a75f42784254fae349c2f6e3","amp;dn":"Roger+McGuinn+-+Born+To+Rock+And+Roll+%281991%29+FLAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d504daa4dd3adb6a75f42784254fae349c2f6e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,80,77,170,77,211,173,182,167,95,66,120,66,84,250,227,73,194,246,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
