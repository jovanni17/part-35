world\nYou&amp;#039;ll have to face this house of no escape\nConfront the past, in this psychic house of horrors\nI lead you up the path you&amp;#039;ll take\n\nPanic, your conscience lied\nTrapped inside\nPanic, your ultimate nightmare\nWelcome to the fun palace\n\nPanic, just try to scream\nIt&amp;#039;s only a dream\nPanic, your ultimate nightmare\nWelcome to the palace\n\nTonight you&amp;#039;ll be tried, I invoke the memories\nThe guilt to be driven from this unconscious mind\nYoung lives that you&amp;#039;ve denied, behold their faces\nInnocence cut to pieces, just look behind\n\nPanic, your conscience lied\nTrapped inside\nPanic, your ultimate nightmare\nWelcome to the fun palace\n\nPanic, just try to scream\nIt&amp;#039;s only a dream\nPanic, your ultimate nightmare\nWelcome to the palace\n\nLook at the fun and the games that you&amp;#039;ve taken away\nConfess!\nDreams of growing up have been destroyed\nBecause of you!\n\nFarewell, I impel you back to your other world\nYou&amp;#039;ll have to face your every sin\nTake this a painful bounty, representing me\nThe keeper of the palace and the secrets held within\n\nPanic, your conscience lied\nTrapped inside\nPanic, your ultimate nightmare\nWelcome to the fun palace\n\nPanic, just try to scream\nIt&amp;#039;s only a dream\nPanic, your ultimate nightmare\nWelcome to the palace\n\nGoodbye, from the fun palaceback to top\n\n\n\nRoad To Ruin\t3:43\n\n\nNo control tonight, the lights are going dim\nThe floor begins to tilt, it&amp;#039;s blurring to a spin\nJust let me find my keys, &amp;#039;look down below&amp;#039;\nFresh air is all I need, then I&amp;#039;ll go\n\nLeading up the road to ruin\nYou&amp;#039;re full of alcoholic speed\nLeading up the road to ruin\nNo last chance, don&amp;#039;t bother to plead\n\nHigh, over the limit, got to take it slow\nConcentrate, kill the radio\nIt&amp;#039;s not the first time, it&amp;#039;ll be the last\nI&amp;#039;ve said that before, in the past\n\nLeading up the road to ruin\nYou&amp;#039;re full of alcoholic speed\nLeading up the road to ruin\nNo last chance, don&amp;#039;t bother to plead\n\nSpeed, I&amp;#039;ve got to make it home\n\nNot too far to go, you&amp;#039;re getting near\nJust down the block, there&amp;#039;s nothing left to fear\nCarefree, on top of the world, feeling power\nImpaired security at ninety miles an hour\n\nLeading up the road to ruin\nYou&amp;#039;re full of alcoholic speed\nLeading up the road to ruin\nNo last chance, don&amp;#039;t bother to plead\n\nOutback to top\n\n\n\nSixes And Sevens\t5:20\n\n\nDisillusioned, self-confusion\nTrying to make it through another day\nWhat&amp;#039;s it all for, when does it end\nThere must be another way\n\nWoven webs of intricacy\nA life of nothing new\nNo one here to understand\nPressure&amp;#039;s crushing you\n\nSixes and sevens\nDisorder battles control\nSixes and sevens\nCrises overflow\n\nAggravation deep frustration\nI know what I want to do\nMotivation is a problem\nWhen it&amp;#039;s driven out of you\n\nEmotion, commotion&amp;#039;s\nFilling up the brain\nDirection&amp;#039;s null and void\nAnother drink dilutes the pain\n\nSixes and sevens\nDisorder battles control\nSixes and sevens\nCrises overflow\n\nSinking fast\nWill it last\nAt sixes and sevens\n\nPulling through from yesterday\nAnother day is done\nDetermination\nSelf confidence has won\n\nWoven webs of intricacy\nLife is full of stress\nThat can only hinder\nNew desire to progress\n\nSixes and sevens\nDisorder battles control\nSixes and sevens\nCrises overflow\n\nSinking fast\nWill it last\nAt sixes and sevensback to top\n\n\n\n\nStonewall\t4:51\n\n\n\nStonewall - Go to bat\nUnless you want to live like that\nStonewall - Can&amp;#039;t we see\nWe&amp;#039;re our own worst enemy\n\nA land said to have all, wealth in land, in man\nQualities soon to exhaust as man&amp;#039;s greed poisons the land\nStreams, once fresh, were centres of life for so many a creature\nBeauty without defence, polluted, never to replenish\n\nCollage, blue and green, seen as golden industrial sites\nSmudge as toxic pollutants destroy her remaining rights\nThe power of corporations, spewing chemicals into the air\nFines are imposed to discourage, but what&amp;#039;s a dime to a millionaire\n\nIt&amp;#039;s time to listen, and see the signs\nIt&amp;#039;s time to listen and hear her cries\n\nThe one that gave us life is being burnt to the raw\nReaping unprotected riches, human nature&amp;#039;s self-destruction flaw\nThe power of corporations, spewing chemicals into the air\nFines are imposed to discourage, but what&amp;#039;s a dime to a millionaireback to top\n\n\n\nNever, Neverland\t5:30\n\n\nMy room is full of toys and things\nBut filled with nothing new\nJust me and Clare alone in this\nEnchanted, placid room\nIt&amp;#039;s Saturday and no more school\nThere hasn&amp;#039;t been for years\nShe says we&amp;#039;re here forever\nTill eternity\n\nOur solitude has been disturbed\nClare hold on, don&amp;#039;t flee\nWith open arms they call my name\n&quot;Oh won&amp;#039;t you come with me?&quot;\n\nGet back, back!\nJust leave us all alone\nTake that and that!\nI&amp;#039;ll break your every bone\n\nGet back, back!\nJust leave us all alone\nTake that and that!\nI&amp;#039;ll break your every bone\n\nBlacking out, poisoned\nColours now decay\nDrifting off to never, Neverland\nPlease don&amp;#039;t take me away\nTo never, Neverland\nNo, to the Neverland\n\nTime has passed and now I see\nWhat I&amp;#039;ve lived through\nI&amp;#039;ve got no fears that match the hate\nThat came from you\nIt&amp;#039;s Saturday, I&amp;#039;ve things to do\nI wish you all the best\nNow I leave your placid room\nEnjoy eternal restback to top\n\n\n\nImperiled Eyes\t5:28\n\n\nCenturies of war and waste\nHave dealt a mortal blow\nMother earth begins to rot\nHumanity on death row\nLife does slowly cease to be\nDeath seems so surreal\nAs earth becomes a vacant lot\nThere&amp;#039;s nothing left to heal\n\nNo colour in the skies\nNo one left to blame\nAnd we thought we were wise\nAs I fade, I feel revived\nShocked back into life\nOpening imperilled eyes\nImperilled eyes\n\nCessation of physical life\nBlackness rains from above\nWhat right did power have\nTo annihilate the earth I loved\nNow a barren wasteland\nThe die is cast\nA planet that once did teem with life\nNo evidence of a past\n\nNo colour in the skies\nNo one left to blame\nAnd we thought we were wise\nAs I fade, I feel revived\nShocked back into life\nOpening imperilled eyes\nImperilled eyes\n\nCenturies of war and waste\nHave dealt a mortal blow\nMother earth is now no more\nThere&amp;#039;s nothing left to heal\n\nNo colour in the skies\nNo one left to blame\nAnd we thought we were wise\nAs I fade, I feel revived\nShocked back into life\nOpening imperilled eyes\nImperilled eyesback to top\n\n\n\nKraf Dinner\t2:41\n\n\n\nCupboard&amp;#039;s bare, I&amp;#039;m so hungry\nLife ain&amp;#039;t fair, give me some money\nMacaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack\n\nI love, I love, I love, I love\nKraf Dinner\n\nBoiling water, I can&amp;#039;t wait\nIt&amp;#039;s getting hotter, it feels so great\nMacaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack\n\nI love, I love, I love, I love\nKraf Dinner\n\nWell that was fun, but now that I&amp;#039;m all done\nNow sedate, I think I&amp;#039;ll buy a crate\nMacaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack\n\nI love, I love, I love, I love\nKraf dinner\n\nKraf dinner\nDinner\nKraf dinner\nMy dinner\n\nI want it nowback to top\n\n\nPhantasmagoria\t4:00\n\n\nI have chosen you my friend, you&amp;#039;re mine\nLocked inside this frightening dream\nNowhere to hide\nEvery night my demons you will see\nAn apparition festival, through hell you&amp;#039;ll ride\n\nPhantasmagoria\nSleep well\nPhantasmagoria\nIn hell\n\nSome one here is calling out your name\nLook out, I play inside your brain\nFleeing from my shadows, you&amp;#039;ll never pass my test\nDon&amp;#039;t you know that ghosts never rest\n\nPhantasmagoria\nSleep well\nPhantasmagoria\nIn hell\n\nApproaching, you writhe, we take control\nUnholy inquisition, sentence very cold\nMy servants, demons, take you down the hole\nYour mind destroyed, now I want your soul\n\nPhantasmagoria\nSleep well\nPhantasmagoria\nIn hell\n\nPhantasmagoria\nPhantasmagoria\nIn hell!back to top\n\n\n\nReduced To Ash\t3:09\n\n\nThe sky is falling, timbers they rush down\nAll is in rubble, vomiting sounds\nScreams in the night, yellow and orange\nBlackened indent, future deformed\n\nThe earth it doth shake, molested and torn\nAll living aborted, none left but unborn\nContrived devastation, see all is ruined\nBodies, now corpses, bent, broken and strewn\n\nReduced to ash\nReduced to ash\n\nSelf-contained eternity, we&amp;#039;ve sealed the dawn\nBy torching the sun with the dragons we have spawned\nFarewell to all, it&amp;#039;s time to leave\nChaotic waste, too much to grieve\n\nReduced to ash\nReduced to ash\n\nReduced\nReduced to ashback to top\n\n\nI Am In Command\t3:35\n\n\nNo defence, enemy attack\nI&amp;#039;m fighting for my life\nThey&amp;#039;ll slice you to ribbons, you lose all inhibitions\nI laugh at the Anti-Christ\nPower of position, deploying ammunition\nI&amp;#039;m free from your holy beliefs\nYour pockets are bled, to Christ you&amp;#039;re wed\nGaze at the lost sheep\n\nI am in command\nI am in command\nI stand in command\n\nAll the taking, eyes are waking\nTo your mass control\nPower fades, drunken ways\nCreating your own hellhole\nYour god cast out, my armaments shout\nYour faith is soon null and void\nWhere&amp;#039;s god, paid the church of fraud\nNow heaven&amp;#039;s left you unemployed\n\nI am in command\nI am in command\nI stand in command\n\nMoans of the meek, I&amp;#039;m strong, they&amp;#039;re weak\nI triumph as never before\nStand beside, be string, take pride\nTruth comes from the core\nMy war is fought by those I have taught\nAnd those pledged to be free\nI am here in alliance and stand in defiance\nOf the church&amp;#039;s almighty greed\n\nI am in command\nI am in command\nI stand in command","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0238cea432213e45bbc169df26a75b96b3cde470","amp;dn":"Annihilator-Never+Neverland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0238cea432213e45bbc169df26a75b96b3cde470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,56,206,164,50,33,62,69,187,193,105,223,38,167,91,150,179,205,228,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
