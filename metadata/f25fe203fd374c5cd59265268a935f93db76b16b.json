Line up changes were more than frequent til the second \nofficial strike which was nothing more that the re-release of the demo in a 4 way split with SUFFERATORY (russia), DEMISE (Philippines)\n and Mark Riddick's UNBURIED (USA), through Coyote Records. \n\nThe bastards gained experience by sharing the stage with acts such as Aborted,\n Severe Torture, Obscura, Belphegor, Dark Fortress among others, thus the recordings of the debut album started taking place in Grindhouse\n Studios Athens. Produced by George Bokos of the mighty Rotting Christ, the songs gained a massive sound and the album under the title \n&quot;Resuscitation&quot; was ready after thousands of work hours.\n\nA search for label followed and after sometime the kind lads of Coyote Records \nagreed to release our debut in the first months of 2011. We hope you dig the tunes, take the time to listen to our samples and always\n support the underground in any way possible.\n\ncheers, beers, meat.\n\n\n\n\nPretty unusual to hear death metal coming from Greece as the Greek\n underground is more crowded by black or black death metal but we wonÃŽÂ¥t complain about that.\nThe comrades take in charge the musical\n duty and chose the brutal death metal way with rather efficient riffs easy to remember but a bit still heard before. MORTAL TORMENT \nsometimes plays in the deathcore way I donÃŽÂ¥t like those parts which I consider too much predictable. Fortunately there are a lot of \nblasting parts that impose MORTAL TORMENT as a brutal band. I hope MORTAL TORMENT will keep the death metal side and even increase it.\n\n\n\nTRACK LISTING\nAmphetamine Murder\nExhumed Tormentors\nChainsaw Revenge\nDecomposition In Vomit\nMortal Torment\nProfane\nInfernal \nAudium Schizophrenia\nResuscitation\nCarnivorous Surgery\n\n\n289VBR\n44.100kHz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Mortal+Torment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Mortal+Torment&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Mortal_Torment/73230&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Mortal_Torment/73230&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f25fe203fd374c5cd59265268a935f93db76b16b","amp;dn":"Mortal+Torment+-+Decomposition+In+Vomit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f25fe203fd374c5cd59265268a935f93db76b16b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,95,226,3,253,55,76,92,213,146,101,38,138,147,95,147,219,118,177,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
