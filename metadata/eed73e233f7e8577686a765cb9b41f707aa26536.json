Without straying at all from their roots, the band adds a little more funk to their sound a la Primus, which makes for a more consistent set of songs than their debut. Not to mention that the stars shine brighter than they did last time around: &quot;Spacegrass&quot; alone should have become an instant classic, but following minor rotation on hard rock stations, the song -- and the band with it -- were  delegated a cult status, compared to the likes of contemporaries Coal Chamber and Korn. \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Big news I [05:14] \n 02.Big news II [02:23] \n 03.Rock N' roll outlaw [02:59] \n 04.Texan book of the dead [02:57] \n 05.Escape from the prison [04:54] \n planet \n 06.Space grass [06:33] \n 07.I have the body of john [04:27] \n wilkes booth \n 08.Tight like that [04:50] \n 09.Animal farm [02:01] \n 10.Droid [04:44] \n 11.The house that peterbilt [03:33] \n 12.7 jam [06:18] \n 13.Tim sult vs. the greys [04:12] \n ____ \n \n 55:05 min \n 83,7 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed73e233f7e8577686a765cb9b41f707aa26536","amp;dn":"Clutch-Clutch-%28Retail%29-1995-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eed73e233f7e8577686a765cb9b41f707aa26536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,215,62,35,63,126,133,119,104,106,118,92,185,180,31,112,122,162,101,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
