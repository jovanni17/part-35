The cover artwork was created by indie comics personality Mark Beyer (of Amy and Jordan fame). The album itself approaches free jazz from the perspective of hardcore punk, particularly taking note of the contemporary innovations of thrashcore and grindcore. Zorn would later pursue these preoccupations in the thrash jazz group Naked City.\n\nLike some classic free jazz albums (Free Jazz, Ascension, Archie Shepp's Mama Too Tight), different saxophonists improvise simultaneously in stereo. Tim Berne appears on the left channel, while John Zorn is recorded on the right channel.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll compositions by Ornette Coleman.\n\n&quot;WRU&quot; - 2:38\n&quot;Chronology&quot; - 1:08\n&quot;Word for Bird&quot; - 1:14\n&quot;Good Old Days&quot; - 2:44\n&quot;The Disguise&quot; - 1:18\n&quot;Enfant&quot; - 2:37\n&quot;Rejoicing&quot; - 1:38\n&quot;Blues Connotation&quot; - 1:05\n&quot;C. &amp; D.&quot; - 3:05\n&quot;Chippie&quot; - 1:08\n&quot;Peace Warriors&quot; - 1:20\n&quot;Ecars&quot; - 2:28\n&quot;Feet Music&quot; - 4:45\n&quot;Broad Way Blues&quot; - 3:42\n&quot;Space Church&quot; - 2:28\n&quot;Zig Zag&quot; - 2:54\n&quot;Mob Job&quot; - 4:24\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohn Zorn: alto saxophone\nTim Berne: alto saxophone\nMark Dresser: bass\nJoey Baron: drums\nMichael Vatcher: drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93a4a460cb186b9efa02b4e2ebc2a14941ad7076","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Spy+Vs.+Spy+%281989%29+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93a4a460cb186b9efa02b4e2ebc2a14941ad7076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,164,164,96,203,24,107,158,250,2,180,226,235,194,161,73,65,173,112,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
