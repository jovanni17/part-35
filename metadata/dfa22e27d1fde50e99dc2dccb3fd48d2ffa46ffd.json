MPC is pure VBR and is designed to be as transparent as possible. \n\n----------------\n\nWinamp users:\n\nCopy in_mpc.dll to the Winamp plugins folder, then restart Winamp.\n\nMake sure you NEVER have the equalizer on when playing MPC!\nIt will mess up the sound, so make sure it is OFF!\n\n--------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa22e27d1fde50e99dc2dccb3fd48d2ffa46ffd","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+6+Original+Sound+Version+%5BEAC-MPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa22e27d1fde50e99dc2dccb3fd48d2ffa46ffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,162,46,39,209,253,229,14,153,220,45,204,179,253,72,210,255,164,111,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
