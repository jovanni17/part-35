Rare breed pig farmer Jimmy Doherty has a dream to make free range food affordable for everyone. So he's challenged Britain's biggest supermarket, Tesco, to let him prove he can do it, and they've agreed. Animal welfare standards might have come a long way in the UK, but most of the country's chickens are still reared intensively, 60% of pigs still spend their whole lives in sheds, and tens of thousands of dairy calves are needlessly slaughtered each year because it's too expensive to rear them. Jimmy's taking on three of Tesco's best-selling own brand products and will work with the company to try and make higher-welfare versions for the same affordable price. If he's successful, they'll launch them in their stores.\n\n\n1)  Meatballs \nJimmy tries to transform Tesco's best-selling own brand meatballs (they sell 35 million of them a year). In doing so, he spots an opportunity to tackle one of dairy farming's biggest secrets - the killing each years of tens of thousands of male dairy calves because there's no market for them. Jimmy believes these calves should be reared on to produce British rose veal - a high welfare, high quality meat. Can he persuade dairy farmers to work with him, come up with a recipe to impress Tesco, and convince the public that the stigma surrounding veal is a thing of the past?\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img403.imageshack.us/img403/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img403.imageshack.us/img403/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/3608/jimmyandthegiantsuperma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2068 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 48.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Doherty_%28farmer%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Doherty_%28farmer%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95f013e57ccac2dcf7c6989e36f85f235d632b4f","amp;dn":"Ch4+Jimmy+And+The+Giant+Supermarket+1of3+Meatballs+PDTV+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95f013e57ccac2dcf7c6989e36f85f235d632b4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,240,19,229,124,202,194,220,247,198,152,158,54,248,95,35,93,99,43,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
