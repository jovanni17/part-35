Now the survivors struggle on, living in tiny pockets of civilization scattered across the globe.\n\nFrontier View is one such community, isolated in northern Minnesota where the winters are harsh and wild predators lurk among the shadows. Life isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy, but the people eke out a peaceful existence as hunters and farmers.\n\nThat all changes when John Osborne Ã¢â‚¬â€ survivalist and sharpshooter who answers to no one Ã¢â‚¬â€ comes to town. His arrival ignites a chain of events that will change the North forever, as various factions vying for control of the still rebuilding society hope to swing OsborneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s allegiance to their side.\n\nWhere do OsborneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true loyalties lie? And whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his dark secret? The answers begin here, in this first episode of The Northland Chronicles.\n\nAmazon page: www.amazon.com/dp/B00D4WEN36/\nGoodreads page: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18004338-the-northland-chronicles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af6317a55eff249408f5a132209fc091a98b7a10","amp;dn":"The+Northland+Chronicles+-+A+Stranger+North+%5Bebook%5D%5BPost-apocaly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af6317a55eff249408f5a132209fc091a98b7a10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,99,23,165,94,255,36,148,8,245,161,50,32,159,192,145,169,139,122,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
