He was influenced by Algernon Swinburne, who wrote the line Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time and the Gods are at strifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in his 1866 poem Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hymn to ProserpineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, as well as by the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen. In turn, DunsanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence was felt by H. P. Lovecraft and Ursula K. Le Guin. Arthur C. Clarke corresponded with Dunsany between 1944 and 1956. Those letters are collected in the book Arthur C. Clarke &amp; Lord Dunsany: A Correspondence. Time and the Gods, a series of short stories written in a myth-like style, was first published in 1906.\n\nFrom: BitTorrentScene [BTScene]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d450235d07b48ae1398d81d3ddc041228f30df76","amp;dn":"Time+and+the+Gods+by+Baron+Edward+John+Moreton+Drax+Plunkett+Dun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d450235d07b48ae1398d81d3ddc041228f30df76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,80,35,93,7,180,138,225,57,141,129,211,221,192,65,34,143,48,223,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
