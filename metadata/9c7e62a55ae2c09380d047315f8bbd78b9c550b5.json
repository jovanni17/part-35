Food has become harder to find and what little sources the humans have are considered highly valuable. The most prosperous species on the Earth are &quot;Fairies&quot;, 10 cm tall creatures with high intelligence and a great love for sweets. A nameless girl, the main character, became a UN arbitrator between the humans and the fairies and had returned to her hometown to help her grandfather. One day, the village is sent some strange products made by a company called FairyCo. Since the villagers are wary of using the products, the girl, her grandfather, and a nameless boy decide to go to the factory to find out about the mysterious products and who is behind making them.\n\nGenres: Fantasy, Seinen\n\nThemes: fairies, food, future\n\nAired: Jul 2, 2012\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\nSubTitle language : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c7e62a55ae2c09380d047315f8bbd78b9c550b5","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Jinrui+wa+Suitai+Shimashita+-+01+%5B720p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c7e62a55ae2c09380d047315f8bbd78b9c550b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,126,98,165,90,226,192,147,128,208,71,49,95,139,189,120,185,197,80,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
