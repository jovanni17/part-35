It is often considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas' best work, and is frequently included on lists of the best novels of all time. The writing of the work was completed in 1844. According to the introductory biography in the Penguin Books publication of the novel, Dumas collaborated with others such as Auguste Maquet in the writing to suggest plots and/or historical background for the novel.\n\nThe story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). It is primarily concerned with themes of justice, vengeance, mercy and forgiveness, and is told in the style of an adventure story.\n\nDumas got the idea for The Count of Monte Cristo from a true story, which he found in a memoir written by a man named Jacques Peuchet. Peuchet related the story of a shoemaker named Pierre Picaud, who was living in Paris in 1807. Picaud was engaged to marry a rich woman, but four jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy for England. He was imprisoned for seven years. During his imprisonment a dying fellow prisoner bequeathed him a treasure hidden in Milan. When Picaud was released in 1814, he took possession of the treasure, returned under another name to Paris and spent ten years plotting his successful revenge against his former friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n========================================\nContents | Track titles\n========================================\n\n\nCh 01 _ The Arrival at Marseilles\nCh 02 _ Father and Son\nCh 03 _ The Catalans\nCh 04 _ The Plotters\nCh 05 _ The Betrothal Feast\nCh 06 _ The Deputy Procureur\nCh 07 _ The Examination\nCh 08 _ The Chateau d'If\nCh 09 _ The Evening of the Betrothal\nCh 10 _ The Little Room in the Tuileries\nCh 11 _ The Corsican Ogre\nCh 12 _ Father and Son\nCh 13 _ The Hundred Days\nCh 14 _ In the Dungeons\nCh 15 _ Number 34 and Number 27\nCh 16 _ A Learned Italian\nCh 17 _ In the Abbe's Cell\nCh 18 _ The Treasure\nCh 19 _ The Death of the Abbe\nCh 20 _ The Cemetery of the Chateau d'If\nCh 21 _ The Isle of Tiboulen\nCh 22 _ The Smugglers\nCh 23 _ The Isle of Monte Cristo\nCh 24 _ The Search\nCh 25 _ At Marseilles Again\nCh 26 _ The Inn of Pont Du Gard\nCh 27 _ The Tale\nCh 28 _ The Prison Registers\nCh 29 _ The House of Morrel and Son\nCh 30 _ The Fifth of September\nCh 31 _ Italy _ Sinbad the Sailor\nCh 32 _ The Awakening\nCh 33 _ Roman Bandits\nCh 34 _ Vampa\nCh 35 _ The Colosseum\nCh 36 _ La Mazzolata\nCh 37 _ The Carnival at Rome\nCh 38 _ The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian\nCh 39 _ The Rendezvous\nCh 40 _ The Guests\nCh 41 _ The Breakfast\nCh 42 _ The Presentation\nCh 43 _ Monsieur Bertuccio\nCh 44 _ The House at Auteuil\nCh 45 _ The Vendetta\nCh 46 _ The Rain of Blood\nCh 47 _ Unlimited Credit\nCh 48 _ The Dappled Grays\nCh 49 _ Ideology\nCh 50 _ Haydee\nCh 51 _ The Morrel Family\nCh 52 _ Pyramus and Thisbe\nCh 53 _ Toxicology\nCh 54 _ Robert Le Diable\nCh 55 _ A Talk About Stocks\nCh 56 _ Major Cavalcanti\nCh 57 _ Andrea Cavalcanti\nCh 58 _ At the Gate\nCh 59 _ M.
