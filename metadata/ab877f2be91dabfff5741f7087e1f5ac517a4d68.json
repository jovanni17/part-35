In the aftermath\nof the war started by humanity itself, the earth's ecosystem was irrecoverably affected, and it\nhad no choice but to escape the now devastated earth to live in space. A new era began with the\nStar Calendar 0000. Shortly afterwards entertainment was prohibited by law and the sacred place for\notaku, Akihabara, became the public entertainment's absolute area of defense and the only place to\nperform such activities. In Star Calendar 0048 once more a group was formed in the hope to resume the\nlegacy of the legendary idol act AKB48, which continued to shine even during the earth's downfall.\nWith the law in place they were deemed as an illegal act and unable to hold official live events.\nThis is when the group's concept changed. Instead of the idols you can meet they became the idols\nwho come to meet you. Branded as terrorists by authorities they didn't give up and decided to take\nup arms to protect the stage they stand on, the fans who cheer for them and the citizens who are\ndeprived of entertainment.\n\nThis is the tale of those girls who succeeded the famous name and fight for the freedom of\nentertainment. Their name is... AKB0048. \n\n\n\nVIDEO\nVideo Source: BD-J\nVideo Codec: H.264/AVC\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720p HD (16:9)\nVideo FPS: 23.976\n\nAUDIO\nCodec: AAC-LC\nTrack 1: English: Stereo\nTrack 2: Japanese: Stereo\n\nSUBTITLES\nTrack 1: English Signs/Songs\nTrack 2: English Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab877f2be91dabfff5741f7087e1f5ac517a4d68","amp;dn":"%5BCBM%5D+AKB0048+1-13+Complere+%28Dual+Audio%29+%5BBDRip-720p-8bit%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab877f2be91dabfff5741f7087e1f5ac517a4d68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,135,127,43,233,29,171,255,245,116,31,112,135,225,245,172,81,122,77,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
