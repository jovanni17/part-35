While it can be used to great effect by writers of all kindsÃ¢â‚¬â€bloggers, journalists, academic and business writersÃ¢â‚¬â€many of its features are specific to creative writers, such as the ability to examine dialog separate from the prose that surrounds it.\nThough a central component of SmartEdit is the Word Processor, where you can make changes in response to the results of the various checks, it is not set up to handle headers, footnotes or images. This means that it is not suitable for working on a final manuscript that has been carefully formatted in preparation for submission to a publisher. It's designed to be used well before you reach the manuscript preparation stage.\nSmartEdit sits in the middle of the writing processÃ¢â‚¬â€after you have finished your first draft, but before you get to the point of carefully preparing your manuscript for submission. It's an ideal tool to be used in conjunction with software such as Word, Scrivener or PageFour.\n\nWhat Does SmartEdit Do?\nSmartEdit runs a series of 20 individual checks on your work and highlights areas that might need to be looked at. These checks include: highlighting repeated phrases and words, producing a list of every adverb used, flagging possible misused or misspelled words such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“complementÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ instead of Ã¢â‚¬Å“complimentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nSmartEdit also examines your sentence structures: highlighting common phrases you use to begin sentences, monitoring sentence length, as well as flagging possibly incorrect punctuation, such as multiple exclamation marks (Ã¢â‚¬Å“!!!?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), or inconsistent use of smart quotes and straight quotes.\nWhat Does SmartEdit NOT Do?\nIt does not tell you to remove or replace a word. It does not make any automated changes for you. It does not tell you whether your work might be good, bad, or somewhere in between.\nThese decisions and interpretations are yours, and only yours to make. Software cannot make them for you, and should not even try. After all, how many repeated phrases are to be found in Martin Luther KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Have a DreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ speech? Would that speech be remembered today if Dr. King had removed all but one of those Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have a dreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ phrases in response to a software prompt?\nSmartEditÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s results should be used as a starting point in your editing process. They should by no means be taken as Gospel. It's your work, your creative endeavor; you know far more about it than an automated tool does.\nWho Would Benefit Most From SmartEdit?\nAre you a published author? Are you planning to become a published author? Have you finished or are you close to finishing a first draft of a novel or short story? If you answered yes to any of these questions, SmartEdit is for you.\nSmartEdit was built for writers who are serious about their craft. It works best and helps most when it has content to work with. That meansÃ¢â‚¬â€at the very leastÃ¢â‚¬â€a finished first draft. If you're not quite there yet, you should hold off on using SmartEdit until you've reached that final page.\n\nSupported OS: \n\nWindows 7, Windows 8, Vista, XP (SP3) \n\nHomepage: http://www.smart-edit.com\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with any name and given key.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5ad2c87f8c2382b26dd3b1d939493675bf752cb","amp;dn":"Bad+Wolf+Software+SmartEdit+v3.211+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5ad2c87f8c2382b26dd3b1d939493675bf752cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,173,44,135,248,194,56,43,38,221,59,29,147,148,147,103,91,247,82,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
