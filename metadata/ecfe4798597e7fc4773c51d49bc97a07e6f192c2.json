Based on former classics like Marble Madness, you take control of a marble, rolling it through a number of levels. Each level includes tricky obstacles for you to navigate.\n\nExclusive to the Nintendo Wii, Kororinpa makes remarkably good use of the Wii Remote. No button presses are required to play the game, simply tilting the controller will move the world on-screen, rolling your marble in the desired direction.\n\nKororinpa can be picked up and played by anyone, it's suitable for all ages. Two people can also play at once, in a fun packed race to the end of the level.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecfe4798597e7fc4773c51d49bc97a07e6f192c2","amp;dn":"Kororinpa%3A+Marble+Mania","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecfe4798597e7fc4773c51d49bc97a07e6f192c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,254,71,152,89,126,127,196,119,60,81,212,155,201,122,7,230,241,146,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
