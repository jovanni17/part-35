Abandoned by his mother, he was adopted by a roaming tribe of Buddhist Monk street sweepers, eventually causing him to find inner peace within the gutter.At age 7, young Vermillion fell into an open sewer. After being trapped for three days he was finally rescued. Unconscious and badly hurt. When he awoke he could only communicate in swear words for a year and his voice was severely damaged from the septic fumes. He also sustained a head injury, resulting in his first set of black eyes which would lead to the nick name he still bears to this day.At 11 Vermillion set out to see the world but mostly saw it from behind bars. As he stumbled around the world from bus stations to bars to shelters to jails, he was always just lucky enough to cross paths with some of the most talented people in the underground music scene. Stevie Tombstone, One Armed Willie, Handsome Andy Gibson, Cornelious Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe PainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wickenburg, Joe Buck Yourself, Heathen Bill, Stix the Clown, Whiskey Dick and of course the legendary Shelton Williams the 1st were just a few of the people that would help him realize that he had absolutely NO musical talent! But they also taught him that it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter as long as there was a song in his heart.\n\n\nA fusion of Blues, Folk, Swing, Bluegrass, Grindcore and Punk from Gary Lindsey (Hank Williams IIIs - Assjack) and Whiskey Dick.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54613513cb125813d2f47faac9fe75625c9e1207","amp;dn":"Black+Eyed+Vermillion+-+Black+Eyed+Vermillion+%282008%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54613513cb125813d2f47faac9fe75625c9e1207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,97,53,19,203,18,88,19,210,244,127,170,201,254,117,98,92,158,18,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
