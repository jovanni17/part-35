Ned Kelly Uncovered follows the first ever excavation of the Glenrowan Inn site where the iconic Australian bushranger and his gang holed up for a showdown with police. The dramatic siege ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which lasted over 24 hours ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ended with Ned KellyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capture and the death of gang members Joe Byrne, Dan Kelly and Steve Hart. Nearly 130 years later, can a team of archaeologists and historians reveal new insights into Ned KellyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final moments of freedom?\n\nMore than a century after the Kelly Gang rode the ranges of Victoria and NSW, holding up towns and stealing thousands of pounds, opinion remains passionately divided between those who love Kelly as a persecuted champion of the poor and those who dismiss him as a cold-blooded killer and thief.\n\nWill the dig site shed new light on the motivations of a man cast into legend by history? Or have souvenir hunters destroyed any chance historians have of uncovering the truth?\n\nWith expert commentary from Kelly experts Ian Jones and Alex McDermott, this one-hour documentary follows a seven-week dig led by archaeologist Adam Ford.\n\nAs the archaeologists unearth a host of artefacts including cartridges and bullets, the team conducts tests with fascinating results. Meanwhile, the historians strip back the myth, piecing together the clues to give a detailed new look at an iconic Australian, literally from the ground up.\n\nMedia Info:\n\nDirector/Writer: Alex West\nProducers: Alex West, Lucy Maclaren\nExecutive Producers: Mark Hamlyn (Screen Australia), Alex West (Renegade Films), Joe Connor, Ken Connor\nPresenter: Tony Robinson\nDuration: 55 minutes\nYear: 2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d39e95b7bf9252e45dc29aa871bad03953c068d6","amp;dn":"NED+KELLY+UNCOVERED+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d39e95b7bf9252e45dc29aa871bad03953c068d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,158,149,183,191,146,82,228,93,194,154,168,113,186,208,57,83,192,104,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
