Adopting as both his business and personal mission statement a vow to &quot;positively impact the whole person,&quot; Kevin has been involved in a vast array of business enterprises that marketed or sold products that he personally used and believed in 100%. Having been personally responsible for over $2 billion in business world-wide, Kevin knows from personal experience how big business and government try to debunk individuals who promote products that could hurt the profits of the giant multinational corporations. Kevin spends most of his time spearheading a website that promotes education about natural healing therapies; and a website that exposes corporate and government abuse and corruption. Kevin is actively pursuing lawsuits against the individuals, corporations and government agencies that take advantage of the average consumer. He is also dedicated to the formation of various foundations to pursue these goals, and has donated much of his fortune for that purpose.\n\nOne more thing ...\n\nAlthough the above is the usual commercial description for this book, it is also fair to add that the author has been involved in several controversial affairs.
