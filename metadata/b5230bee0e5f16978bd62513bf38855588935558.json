I'm Casey Kasem and the countdown doesn't stop until we get to number one.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What is the longest running number one record in chart history?&quot; Casey says the song came out in 1950, was number one for 13 consecutive weeks, and then gives the details.\n\nThere is a hit whose proceeds go to the American Red Cross. It is one of two spoken-word recordings in the countdown. The other is &quot;Sister Mary Elephant&quot; (at number 24) by Cheech &amp; Chong.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;Has it ever happened that a group became recording stars, broke up, then got back together and made it to number one on the chart?&quot; Casey says only once, three English brothers who never did make it to number one the first time they were together.\n\nThere is a man in this countdown who became a millionaire as a result of the last minute decision to make him the drummer.\n\nCasey counts down to a song by Brownsville Station (&quot;Smokin' In The Boys Room&quot; at number 3), and then tells what station in Brownsville broadcasts his countdown!\n\n40:    A Love Song - Anne Murray\n39:    Baby Come Close - Smokey Robinson\n38:    I Love - Tom T.
