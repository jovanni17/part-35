Drummond\n\tPaul Ford\t... \t                 C.P.

Its stellar cast of veteran American actors present a magnificent example of ensemble acting. Burgess Meredith in particular turns in a virtuoso performance. Henry Fonda, Joanne Woodward and Jason Robards anchor the film with delightful portrayals.\n\n   The surprise plot twist at the end does jar the emotions a little, but is in keeping with the fun and mischievous spirit of the film. Definitely more stylish and funnier than &quot;The Sting&quot;. Action, adventure, comedy, suspense ----- this well-crafted tale has it all. It deserves the term &quot;classic&quot;. \n\n   An unusual western with no villains, gunfights, barroom brawls etc. Nice to see a western with regular people. Kids who see westerns must think that the west was really wild in every town. Simple plot of meek husband and wife and child who come to town in the midst of a popular once a year poker game going on. They get mixed up in it with lots of fun and twists. Great cast with the always reliable Henry Fonda and Joanne Woodward and a super supporting cast. The young boy playing their son had great expressive eyes and was ideal in his role. Some might figure out what's going on, but don't think too hard. Just sit back, relax and enjoy what you see. Nice DVD transfer as well. Would have been nice to have included a commentary by Woodward as she is the only surviving cast member I believe. For a big time delight see this BIG HAND FOR THE LITTLE LADY. \n\nIMDB:   tt0060165","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1334124b73ca93f7ba4ea6e7b2a81fa599b3f7b0","amp;dn":"A+Big+Hand+For+The+Little+Lady+%28Henry+Fonda%29+%5B1966%5D+%40%60+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1334124b73ca93f7ba4ea6e7b2a81fa599b3f7b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,52,18,75,115,202,147,247,186,78,166,231,178,168,31,165,153,179,247,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
