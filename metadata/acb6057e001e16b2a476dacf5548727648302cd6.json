The term can be defined broadly, to encompass the faith traditions outside the Abrahamic monotheistic group of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The term Pagan is from Latin paganus, an adjective originally meaning &quot;rural&quot;, &quot;rustic&quot; or &quot;of the country.&quot; As a noun, paganus was used to mean &quot;country dweller, villager.&quot; In colloquial use, it could mean much the same as calling someone today a &amp;#039;country bumpkin&amp;#039; or a &amp;#039;hillbilly&amp;#039;.\nSoruce: Wikipedia\n\nBefore Christianity arrives in Northern Europe, including places that is now known as France, Germany, Great Britain and Scandinavia, the people who lived there where by definition all Pagans believing in Pagan religions with Pagan culture. In other words, from the perspective of the Christians ?we were all Hillbillies? who lived here in northern Europe. The Vikings in the far north was the last people who converted to Christianity. When groups of people convert to another belief system and an other religion. That never comes easily. Think about in terms of yourself converting from Christianity to Islam or the other way around for instance. One of the main reasons of the bad reputation of the Pagans and their culture and religions is in fact the product of Christian propaganda over the decays. Through history and prehistory, the representations of the ancient gods and traditions followed by pagans have been marred by propaganda from other religious groups eager to rein in those they defined as `wild barbarians`.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Author/Presenter - Richard Rudgley\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRichard Rudgely is an Oxford-trained anthropologist and critically acclaimed author of &quot;Lost Civilisations of the Stone Age&quot; Also winner of the Prometheus Award, British Museum.

Some of this is propaganda, generated by early Christians as part of their attempt to oust the old religions. However, it also reflects the pagan view that human beings are equal to and interdependent with the world they inhabit and that sexuality is a powerful and natural element in people?s lives. Though historical accounts lead us to images of stone dildo-wielding women flashing their genitals at cattle, chieftains having sex with horses before slaughtering them and whipping sessions in mixed saunas, the underlying theme is of human similarity with animals and nature. Where modern religion aims to emphasise the difference between humans and the world around us, portraying sexuality as taboo, the ancient pagan perspective blurs these boundaries and explores all the elements of the world on equal terms.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther torrents related to my favorite subject; humans and human behaviour:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb6057e001e16b2a476dacf5548727648302cd6","amp;dn":"Channel+4+-+Pagans+1+of+4+Sexy+Beasts+-+Richard+Rudgley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb6057e001e16b2a476dacf5548727648302cd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,182,5,126,0,30,22,178,164,118,218,207,85,72,114,118,72,48,44,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
