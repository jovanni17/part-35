According to legend, Ludwig stockpiled a massive treasure in the years before his death, a cache of gold and jewels that would finance the construction of the largest castle of all time. But in the years since his death, no one has found any evidence that Ludwig had hid anything. Until now.\nJonathon Payne and David Jones are pulled into the mystery by a colleague of theirs, a former supply sergeant in the U.S. military who asks them to investigate. They agree to help and quickly find themselves in a life-or-death struggle to uncover the truth about Ludwig's murder and his mythical treasure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c524321e27bbc6ccbf5a226a5ada905401e931a","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Crown+-+Chris+Kuzneski.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c524321e27bbc6ccbf5a226a5ada905401e931a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,82,67,33,226,123,188,108,203,245,162,38,165,173,169,5,64,30,147,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
