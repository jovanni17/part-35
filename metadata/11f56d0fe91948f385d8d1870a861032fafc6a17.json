With ages ranging from 16-24 and eclectic musical tastes, matched only by their diverse cultural and social backgrounds, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique sound was almost an inevitability.\n\nThe London-based collective consists of members Ali Bla Bla (rapper / producer), KoKen (rapper), Danny Wilder (lead singer / guitars / rapper), Rich Pun (guitars), Memari Man (bass), 8 Bit (synths / co-producer) and Royal (drums).\n\nThe KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s have been busy tearing down venues across the capital, headlining hotspots such as the Jazz Cafe and Cargo. Recent shows have taken their high-octane, crowd-pleasing antics across the country, steadily garnering them a large and loyal following along the way.\n\nDriven by a shared love of music that pushes the envelope, KINGS OF THE CITY are regularly recording new material and releasing videos. Their latest track Ã¢â‚¬ËœDarknessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ features a guest vocal from UK rap legend Klashnekoff and has picked up strong support on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.\n\nTwitter:\n\nFacebook:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11f56d0fe91948f385d8d1870a861032fafc6a17","amp;dn":"Kings+of+the+City+%26gt%3B+Volume+2+%26gt%3B+FLAC+Format.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11f56d0fe91948f385d8d1870a861032fafc6a17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,245,109,15,233,25,72,243,133,216,209,135,10,134,16,50,250,252,106,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
