So what you can expect is less annoying people telling you what they think, and we let you make up your own mind. Welcome to the new age! In case you are wondering, the magazine is pronounced as Ã¢â‚¬Å“FÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Think what you want with it, but our stand will be that film is too, after all, only and also a four-letter word. All the content in this mag is exclusive and straight-to-the-point, no f***ing bullshit.
