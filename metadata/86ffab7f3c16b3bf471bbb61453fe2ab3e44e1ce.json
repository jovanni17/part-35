Definitely competition for Blood and Fire and Pressure Sounds labels.\n\nSo, refreshingly, these are all original rhythms, no do overs of over familiar drum and bass lines. The production values are beautiful - serious and heavy Rockers drum patterns with an almost Black Ark ambience, even though it was recorded at the little known Concert Studios in Kingston JA.\n\nThe vocal harmonies are beautiful: Those of you that love Eric Donaldson, The Meditations, The Congos, Israel Vibration and Earth and Stone will undoubtedly be pleased with this release. It also sounds similar in style and spirit to The Upsetter track &quot;Mash Down&quot; from the Pressure Sounds &quot;Voodooism&quot; album.\n\n\nMakasound have done a great job here, proving themselves to be a label worthy of respect. \n\nTracklisting\n\n1.\tRasta Business\n2.\tSinking In The Mist\n3.\tBackyard Movement\n4.\tGood Thing Going On\n5.\tNearer To Africa\n6.\tOne Black People\n7.\tDonÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t Say You DonÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t Love\n8.\tSata\n\n\nArt work included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86ffab7f3c16b3bf471bbb61453fe2ab3e44e1ce","amp;dn":"The+Mighty+Threes+Afric+Shall+Stretch+For+Her+Hand+Extended+Mixe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86ffab7f3c16b3bf471bbb61453fe2ab3e44e1ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,255,171,127,60,22,179,191,71,27,187,97,69,63,226,171,62,68,225,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
