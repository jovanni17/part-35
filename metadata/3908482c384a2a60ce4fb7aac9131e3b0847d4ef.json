The new authors contained in this first volume are: Filipa Marques JÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âºnior, Dominic LaferriÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¨re, Kajsa ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“brink, Annette Lyth, Mona Ressaissi, Malin KÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ll and George Jokhadze. \n\nThe issues they discuss are those which have been high on international agendas during recent years: human rights and the fight against terrorism; the human rights of women; state responsibility to ensure adequate standards of living; and the human rights accountability of transnational corporations. \n\nCollectively, the authors demand the revision of the inadequate theoretical and practical approaches in international human rights law. They address the challenges presented by the world we live in and suggest solutions that are flexible, preserve human dignity and topple the unnecessary barriers between theories and areas of legal regulation. \n\nThe introduction to the volume by Professor Ineta Ziemele notes the importance of human rights education; the writings in this series are one example of the achievements of that education.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3908482c384a2a60ce4fb7aac9131e3b0847d4ef","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2005%5D+Expanding+the+Horizons+of+Human+Rights+Law+%28The+Rao","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3908482c384a2a60ce4fb7aac9131e3b0847d4ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,8,72,44,56,74,42,96,206,79,183,170,201,19,30,59,8,71,212,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
