After many setbacks and promises, Example released a 13 track limited edition mixtape available through the internet or at concerts during his Spring 2007 tour supporting Plan B,The Rifles, and Just Jack). Underneath the tracklisting there is an advert for What We Made which is said to come out June 2007. Like this mixtape, it was set back some time, eventually being released in September due to legal issues.\n\nEntitled We Didn&amp;#039;t Invent The Remix (a reference to the P. Diddy album We Invented The Remix) it features 11 tracks sampling a variety of notable artists, including Britney Spears, The Rolling Stones, the most publicity coming from his Lily Allen parody that received some airplay. While the tracks aren&amp;#039;t straight covers of the original songs, they do use the theme of the song, or perhaps a few lines from the chorus, as their subject matter. There are also two bonus tracks which are original compositions by Example and Rusher that had previously featured as B-Sides on the vinyl release of his singles What We Made and You Can&amp;#039;t Rap; his first single featured track 2, Loneliness costs, as its B-Side.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1.
