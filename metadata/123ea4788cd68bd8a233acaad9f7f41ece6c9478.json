Rules-Based Automation allows you to specify simple but powerful rules that basically tell the system that if event X occurs, perform action Y. Rules-Based Automation runs in the background, and as soon as a specified event occurs, it immediately triggers the specified action. The possibilities are limited only by the number of events your system can Ã¢â‚¬ËœseeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the number of Ã¢â‚¬ËœactionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ it can perform.\n\nRules-Based Automation allows you to create automatic rules for any existing manual event, business process, or daily step in your printing production workflow. As a result, you can organize all stages of print production, enabling your business to run much more effortlessly.
