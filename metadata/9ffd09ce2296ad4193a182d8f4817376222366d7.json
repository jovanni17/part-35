Fresh off a well deserved ski vacation in the Rocky Mountains, where the music also took some time to stretch and relax, Widespread Panic charged into the Spring Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ96 tour with a renewed sense of energy and perspective.  On April 3rd at the Von Braun Civic Center in Huntsville, Alabama, it all came together and made an indelible mark on Panic history.
