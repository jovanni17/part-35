I have never seen this material anywhere else, Lee Brown was authorized in the 80s to speak at large about his people&amp;#039;s prophecies. And this speaker is the first to do so.Nuclear weapons and jet aircraft were apparently forseen by the ancient shaman.\n The video quality is terrible, this is a 500 th generation bootleg of a bootleg, the fact that it exists at all is amazing, as I recorded this copy for my aunt in 1987.She returned the battered vhs tape and this is how it comes to you.It is worth it for the audio alone, if you are interested in this sort of thing. I love you all.peace.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b49c1b68cbb6a634dc4e77ed0fb3d321e830969f","amp;dn":"Lee+Brown-+Hopi+Prophecy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b49c1b68cbb6a634dc4e77ed0fb3d321e830969f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,156,27,104,203,182,166,52,220,78,119,237,15,179,211,33,232,48,150,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
