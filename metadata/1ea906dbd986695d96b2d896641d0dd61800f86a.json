Originally\nI had hoped that the 'Installer' and 'Patches' could be\npruned and compressed enough to fit on a single dual-layer\nDVD, but ultimately was unable to get under the limit. For \nthat reason I have included a 'Plan B' for single disc \nbackup- see details below.\n\n                                                                                                                        \n\n\n\n...also see the ReadMe for information about an 'express install' method to cut down on the time it takes to install and patch WoW - WotLK while the rest of the torrent is downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea906dbd986695d96b2d896641d0dd61800f86a","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+-+Wrath+of+the+Lich+King+-+3.3.5a+%3A+Installer+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea906dbd986695d96b2d896641d0dd61800f86a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,169,6,219,217,134,105,93,150,178,216,150,100,29,13,214,24,0,248,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
