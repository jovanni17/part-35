Brett Florens is a South African photographer who selected 75 of his favorite bridal portraits to explore in detail, giving the reader an inside look at both the creative development of each concept before the shoot and the technical execution of the photographerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and brideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision. Featuring brides with a variety of looks, from classic to fashion forward, and images shot both indoors and outside, the book provides instruction on a wide range of techniques. Florens is a master of lighting, so lighting diagrams are provided for each image, making it easy for readers to adapt the setups to their own subjects and shooting style. Posing techniques are also covered in detail, with tips for both refining the appearance of the bride and for communicating something about her personality through the pose selected. Florens is also well known for his fashion-inspired poses, and the aesthetic concepts that make them work effectively are explored. With tips for remaining true to personal style while working to satisfy the tastes and demands of a variety of brides, it will be a valuable addition to the library of any professional photographer or advanced student of photography.\n\n[center][IMG]http://i1301.photobucket.com/albums/ag107/Bronte_Bear/firesig_zpse331b82a.gif[/IMG][/center]\n[center]Feel free to make any book requests here, I check every day:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a382d6aeab244013520739ee8e4a78d2f3242430","amp;dn":"Modern+Bridal+Photography+Techniques+2013+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a382d6aeab244013520739ee8e4a78d2f3242430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,130,214,174,171,36,64,19,82,7,57,238,142,74,120,210,243,36,36,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
