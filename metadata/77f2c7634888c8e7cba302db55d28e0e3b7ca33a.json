Such is the case of the Mexican outfit Jesus on Dope, located in the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capital, and whose creative nucleus consists of the drummer Emmanuel Grooviedelik and the bass guitar player Basstard Motherfucker. Ever since their first EP, Haze (2010, 16 minutes), theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had changes in their line up and in their instrumentation; but they have also assimilated, within their nucleus, the guitar player The Rebellious Son. In April this year they released their most recent production, Diabolik, an extended play (only just over the seventeen minute mark) in which they continue their experimentation on the creation of musical landscaping. Furthermore, they have also integrated the sound of Rolo Stoned's guitar and Mr. Groove's harmonica for this record, their second EP. As it is customary in the record releases of this band, the recording and composition's quality does give the record an artisanal value; it is also worth noting that the record's pressing is limited to 100 numbered copies. The record also has the collaborations of DJake de la Cueva playing keyboards on tracks 1 &amp; 3, and of Truko Casasola playing percussions on track 3. The first landscape, titled Dick Diggler, builds chaos within a bleak dimension and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s framed by a cloud of psychedelic abstraction. The second landscape, Twisted Stranger, is a space western adorned by the subtlest melancholy of the harmonica that is then blasted by acoustic guitars that interleave delirious rhythms, until itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s consumed by distorted guitars and a hypnotizing bass. The third and last landscape, Diabolik, exhibits all the strengths of Jesus on Dope: awesome bass riffs, hectic guitar solos, and classic psychedelia Ã¢â‚¬â€an auditory saturation that stimulates all the senses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f2c7634888c8e7cba302db55d28e0e3b7ca33a","amp;dn":"Jesus+on+dope+-+Diabolik","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77f2c7634888c8e7cba302db55d28e0e3b7ca33a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,242,199,99,72,136,200,231,203,163,2,219,85,210,142,14,59,124,163,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
