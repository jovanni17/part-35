It could also be argued that anyone with the means is more than willing to profit from it in a monetary way. Here&amp;#039;s Duets: The Final Chapter, released just before Christmas Day 2005, following 1999&amp;#039;s Born Again, which was released just before Christmas Day 1999. Like Born Again, Duets takes bits of unused material from the late legend, and that can entail full-blown verses, looped declarations, or punctuative interjections. On some tracks, Biggie&amp;#039;s presence is no more prominent than a handclap or a snare hit. Check the lead track &quot;It Has Been Said,&quot; where he&amp;#039;s limited to &quot;what,&quot; &quot;ungh,&quot; &quot;yeah,&quot; &quot;ha-ha,&quot; &quot;uh-huh.&quot; If you can get past the fact that a lot of tracks barely feature the headliner, or listen without imagining the original contexts of the patched-together scraps, Duets can be sporadically riveting. The list of guests is overwhelming, with Jay-Z, Nas, Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, R. Kelly, T.I., Slim Thug, Eminem, Lil Wayne, Missy Elliott, the Clipse, Snoop Dogg, and Freeway representing roughly half of the involved. Only a few tracks contain significant Biggie contributions, and it&amp;#039;s not as if they provide any further insight or add to his long-established legend. Many of his vocals are not pulled from professional studio-quality recordings, which only makes them sound more displaced. Perhaps Korn&amp;#039;s Jonathan Davis put it best when he told Billboard about the project: &quot;It&amp;#039;s f*ckin&amp;#039; weird to be doing a song with someone who is deceased!&quot; His description applies to what it&amp;#039;s like to listen to the disc. ~ Andy Kellman, All Music Guide\n\n\n1  \tB.I.G.
