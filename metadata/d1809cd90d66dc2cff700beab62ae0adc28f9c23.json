Group keys enable identification by web type and other observable details, and species descriptions include identification tips, typical habitat, geographic distribution, and behavioral notes. A concise illustrated introduction to spider biology and anatomy explains spider relationships. This book is a critical resource for curious naturalists who want to understand this ubiquitous and ecologically critical component of our biosphere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1809cd90d66dc2cff700beab62ae0adc28f9c23","amp;dn":"Common+Spiders+of+North+America+%282012%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1809cd90d66dc2cff700beab62ae0adc28f9c23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,128,156,217,13,102,220,44,255,112,11,234,182,42,224,173,194,143,156,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
