The mixture of  SonnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pianistic AND Eddie ChambleeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tenor sax work was unbeatable .\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLong GoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was followed by many more successful instrumentals that you can find on this record. All these fine driving drag blues place the accent on selling the beat and will make wonderful items for the dance crowd\n\nAnd if you wonder who is the beautiful gal on the front cover, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no more than  Lula Reed ,SonnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife and a terrific blues singer who could hopefully be here on one of our next releases\n\nBandleader and pianist Sonny Thompson was among the most prolific R&amp;B instrumentalists of the late '40s and early '50s. Thompson began recording for Sultan in 1946, then did several sessions for Miracle, King, Federal, and Deluxe, while also backing vocalist Lula Reed from 1951 to 1961. Thompson scored two number one R&amp;B hits for Miracle in 1948: &quot;Long Gone,&quot; Pts. 1 &amp; 2, and &quot;Late Freight.&quot; He landed another Top Ten and two more Top 20 singles for Miracle in 1949, and then had three Top Ten hits for King in 1952. The biggest was &quot;I'll Drown In My Tears,&quot; which reached number five. ~ Ron Wynn, All Music Guide\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Cat On The Keys pt 1(I)\n2. Cat On The Keys pt 2(I)\n3.
