This cutting-edge resource offers a thorough understanding of this emerging application area of GNSS. Written by highly-regarded authorities in the field, this unique reference covers a wide range of key topics, including ground vehicles models, psuedolites, highway vehicle control, unmanned ground vehicles, farm tractors, and construction equipment. The book is supported with over 150 illustrations and more than 180 equations.\nAbout the Author\nDavid Bevly is an associate professor in Department of Mechanical Engineering at Auburn University, where he directs the GPS and Vehicle Dynamics Laboratory (GAVLAB). He is a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Institute of Navigation. He holds an M.S. and Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from MIT and Stanford University, respectively. Stewart Cobb is a founder of Novariant Corporation, where he designs GPS receivers and pseudolites for precise control of air and ground vehicles. He holds an M.S. and Ph.D. in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT and Stanford University, respectively. He also holds an M.S. in systems management for the University of Southern California.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 247 pages\n    * Publisher: Artech House (October 31, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1596933011\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1596933019\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34012568cde8fa2fee26b75b51465cbae1c5b01e","amp;dn":"GNSS+For+Vehicle+Control+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34012568cde8fa2fee26b75b51465cbae1c5b01e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,1,37,104,205,232,250,47,238,38,183,91,81,70,92,186,225,197,176,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
