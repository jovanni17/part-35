Crawford joins Bill to discuss how our government has allowed a few powerful media conglomerates to put profit ahead of the public interest Ã¢â‚¬â€ rigging the rules, raising prices, and stifling competition. As a result, Crawford says, all of us are at the mercy of the biggest business monopoly since Standard Oil in the first Gilded Age a hundred years ago.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The rich are getting gouged, the poor are very often left out, and this means that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re creating, yet again, two Americas, and deepening inequality through this communications inequality,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Crawford tells Bill.\n\nAlso on the show, journalist Nick Turse describes his personal mission to compile a complete and compelling account of the Vietnam WarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horror as experienced by all sides, including innocent civilians who were sucked into its violent vortex.\n\nTurse, who devoted 12 years to tracking down the true story of Vietnam, unlocked secret troves of documents, interviewed officials and veterans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including many accused of war atrocities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and traveled throughout the Vietnamese countryside talking with eyewitnesses to create his book, Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“American culture has never fully come to grips with Vietnam,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Turse tells Bill, referring to Ã¢â‚¬Å“hidden and forbidden histories that just havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been fully engaged.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f93ed6a3afd1128c8606dfb6d9de2340672a8b8","amp;dn":"Who%26rsquo%3Bs+Widening+America%26rsquo%3Bs+Digital+Divide%3F-PBS+Moyers+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f93ed6a3afd1128c8606dfb6d9de2340672a8b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,147,237,106,58,253,17,40,200,96,109,251,109,157,226,52,6,114,168,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
