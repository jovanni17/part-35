A magical voyage through time and space, exploring the history, culture and religions that link East and West: from the Persian Empire of Alexander the Great to the huge Mongolian Empire of Kublai Khan, the destinies of highly developed civilizations intermingled until they converged to take the shape of a Eurasian civilization shared by all of us. Babylon, Persepolis, Ai-Khanoum, Baghdad, RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦are virtually recreated with incomparable realism by computer generated images.\n\n\n              &lt;------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n                   \n\n\nProtected by its great wall and by three thousand years of history, the Middle Kingdom felt forever safe from invaders. That was counting without the hordes of nomadic horsemen who came from the Mongolian steppes, commanded by Kublai.\nThe great Kublai Khan, grandson of Gengis Khan, was born in 1214. He was the very incarnation of twelve centuries of invasions of sedentary civilisations by nomadic people.\n\nHis great ambition was to complete the conquest of the northern part of China ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which his grandfather had started ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ by defeating the southern part of the country. To him, China was more than just an empire: KublaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s goal was to conquer a civilisation and make it his own. Since the beginning of its three thousand-year-old history, China had kept to itself. When conquering Siang Yang, Kublai Khan became the only ruler of the Middle Kingdom. From then on, China, Turkestan, Persia and Russia had been united in one Empire, under the authority of the Mongol princes. For the following century, the newly established Yuans dynasty would continue in the traditional lineage of the old Chinese dynasties. Kublai the Nomad carried the ostentatious mantle of the Chinese emperors and adopted their ceremonial protocol.\n\nFor the first time in its history, the Middle Kingdom opened to the outside world and established direct relations with Persia and the West. The Mongols, who had secured safe passage for the caravans, opened both transcontinental routes, which had been closed since the end of antiquity. Travellers from Europe could from then on take either the Southern route which led through Persia to the Jade Gate, or opt for the Northern route from the Crimea, crossing the south of Siberia reaching China via the north.\n\nIn 1275, a Venetian merchant travelling through Tai-tou, asked to be received by Kublai Khan. His name was Marco Polo who wrote in his memoirs about his reception at the KublaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s palace, describing the magnificence and splendour of his court. Kublai died in Peking in 1294 at the age of 80. It had taken seventy years for the Nomadic horsemen from the steppes in order to make the dream of Alexander the Great come true: unite the East and the West.\n\n\n\nThe Episodes will be uploaded as followed:\n------------------------------------------\n\n1)Alexander The Great Conquers The World\n2)Quest For The Forgotten Alexandria\n3)Ghandhara The Renaissance Of Buddhism\n4)The Romans In China\n5)The Silk Road Unites East And West\n6)Baghdad In The Year 1000\n7)Jerusalem 1227 The Excommunicated Peace\n8)The Mongol Conqueror Kublai KhanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: The Mongol Conqueror Kublai KhanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream\nYear:  2004\nFile Size: 700 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:48:30\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 720x416\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1970 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 183 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (Multisub Scandinavian) Track 1: Danish \n                                   Track 2: Swedish \n                                   Track 3: Norwegian\n                                   Track 4: Finnish\n \n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External Subtitles Included -----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MultiSub Scandianavian  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n                              IMPORTANT: READ ME\n                             --------------------\n\nSTEP 1.\n-------\n\nTo be alble to view the subtitles you need to associate the ---&gt;&gt; &quot;Idx file&quot; and Sub file with a viewer program such as DAMN_NFO_Viewer_...  If you dont have it already download it. It is a free software program that allows you to view the subtitles.\n\nInstall it and run it.It will say something like that&quot; Lets see if it runs&quot; when you are done with the installation. Now go to the (nfo, idx,srt or sub) file and open it. Windows will now prompt you and ask if you want to search on the internet to find witch program fits or is working for the the choosed file &quot;srt nfo or sub&quot;. Choose the second option that says i will search program for my own. When done choosing, a list of all so far association programs will come up. Find DAMN_NFO Viewer and click on it.\n\nThe file is now associated with DAMN_NFO Viewer and you will not need to do thoose steps again. That goes for all srt,nfo,sub,idx files.
