These range from full concerts to fragments of as little as one or two songs.  Most are good quality, but lesser quality recordings may be used for patching, so there are drop-offs in sound quality at times.  And as with many live recordings there can be cuts and fade outs.  This is a music only download if artwork is needed you could probably find art with matching track lists online at the Zeppelin Art site.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve borrowed some comments from the Led Zeppelin database to help with descriptions.\n\nThis isn't meant to be a definitive collection as there are many awesome Led Zeppelin performances in slightly lesser quality out there (for example 1969.01.05 whiskey a go go or 1971.09.29 Osaka).  I was merely trying to get together a collection of great sounding live Led Zeppelin for listening and figured others may like it as well.  So here it is if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re interested.  Thanks, Mike.\n\n\n\nLED ZEPPELIN LIVE A CHRONOLOGICAL CELEBRATION 1969-1973 FLAC\n\n1969.01.11 San Francisco, Fillmore West\nThis is all that is known to exist of this show.  The group experienced some equipment problems which caused the long delays between the songs leading Robert to request the audience, &quot;Has anybody got a Les Paul?  This is also the earliest known live soundboard recording of Led Zeppelin and it's typical of the era, with the vocals and drums to the fore.\n\n1969.03.03 London, Playhouse Theatre\nLed ZeppelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut radio appearance.  This recording includes Communication Breakdown which was left off of the official BBC release.\n\n1969.03.16 Copenhagen, Denmark\nPre-Broadcast FM soundboard.  Four songs with How Many More Times fading out after a couple minutes.\n\n1969.03.17 Gladsaxe, Denmark\nThis is a great mini-show performed for a small television audience, audio is taken from the Led Zeppelin DVD. \n\n1969.03.19 London, Maida Vale Studio\nThis is not available on the official BBC release.  Four songs including Sunshine Woman.  You Shook Me fades out early.\n\n1969.03.25 Staines, England (Supershow)\nZeppelin's contribution to the Supershow movie was this exquisite, compact and powerful version of Dazed And Confused with a really spacey bow section and a ripping finale. The song is incomplete, it was always that way, even on the official Supershow DVD.  The band was set to perform more than just one song but as Jimmy Page recollects: Ã¢â‚¬Å“There was definitely a timeslot for us to do another number, especially as the other artists hadn't arrived, and I suggested to the director that maybe it would be a good opportunity to do Communication Breakdown as a second number, but they declined the offer and said it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessary!&quot;  Audio is taken from the Led Zeppelin DVD.\n\n1969.04.27 San Francisco, Fillmore West\nThe first set has the group firing on all cylinders and playing their hearts out. The second set is more bluesy and laid back.  The only live version of Sittin' and Thinkin', a Buddy Guy number, is here.  Another of the early soundboard recordings.\n\n1969.06.16 London, Aeolian Hall\nAnother great radio broadcast.  Includes two songs they had never played before, The Girl I Love and Something Else.  It also includes What Is And What Should Never Be which was left off of the official BBC release.\n\n1969.06.24 London, Maida Vale Studio\nDuring this short British tour the band was absolutely on peak form and it can be easily heard on this amazing recording. A fury, power and energy are present on all the tracks. Whole Lotta Love is psychedelic stand-out and Robert's yelling during theramin battle is thrilling. Communication Breakdown is devastating and What Is And What Should Never Be is one of the most dramatic versions the band ever played.  A real pearl, Traveling Riverside Blues is Zeppelin's bow to the talent and magic of Robert Johnson and Plant sings some of his &quot;lemon&quot; lyrics.\n\n1969.06.27 London, Playhouse Theatre\nIncludes Dazed And Confused which was left off the official BBC release.  Has unedited versions of Communication Breakdown, White Summer &amp; How Many More Times.  Also includes interviews with Jimmy and Robert and a comedy interlude from members of the Liverpool Scene. \n\n1969.08.31 Lewisville, Texas Pop Festival\nAn excellent show, perfectly consolidating all of the great playing that this tour had produced, from the powerful opener to the extended end of show medley, complete with Plant doing his best adlibs yet. An easy choice for one of the very best shows of the year. Pages amps act up during a few spots in the show, producing brief crackling sounds, as if his guitar cable or a connection somewhere was coming loose. Although not at all a distraction for the listener, this makes for a funny moment during Dazed And Confused and How Many More Times, when Page's amps can be heard briefly picking up the sound of the festival security staff speaking on their radios.\n\n1970.01.09 London, Royal Albert Hall\nIt's Jimmy's 26th birthday party! Gutsy show with totally mind blowing energy. From the first notes of We're Gonne Groove up to the last hints of Long Tall Sally this concert is just exceptional. During one of the verse on Dazed and Confused Plant changes the lyrics and sings: &quot;This cocaine makes me sick!&quot;\n\n1970.03.07 Monteux, Switzerland\nAmazing audience recording with the inferior soundboard recording used to fill gaps and the last two tracks. Talk about energy. The audience is rowdy and loud and the group feed off of this to offer a killer show, with some of the best playing ever, and surely the best live version of Heartbreaker ever played.\n\n1970.03.21 Vancouver, Canada\nThis is all that is known to exist of this show, the first of the North American tour of 1970. Often referred to as &quot;Mudslide&quot; this is taken from a radio broadcast.\n\n1970.04.23 London, Julie Felix Show\nThis is Page's earliest solo performance outside his band while he's playing material known from Zeppelin concerts. A virtuoso performance of White Summer and Black Mountain Side.\n\n1970.09.04 Los Angeles, LA Forum\nThis show captures Zeppelin at their fun and most energetic best. A kicking show with a very Hendrix-inspired Dazed and Confused and the first to last known recording of Out on the Tiles live, as a rare encore, as well as the surprise Blueberry Hill encore. \n\n1971.04.01 London, Paris Cinema\nRobert's voice is amazing, really showing no signs of the flu when he lost it the week before. Bonham is thunderous, Jones plays some of the best and heaviest-sounding bass I have ever heard and Jimmy is on top form. Includes What Is and What Should Never Be and Communication Breakdown which were left off the official BBC release.  Whole Lotto Love Medley is unedited and about seven minutes longer than the official release.\n\n1971.08.31 Orlando, Civic Auditorium\nThis is a very intense and excellent show, including a very daring Dazed And Confused with an eerie White Summer interlude at the end. Soundboard recording using the audience recording to fill in gaps. Several songs in middle of show are from an inferior sounding audience recording.\n\n1971.09.04 Toronto, Canada\nA great version of Celebration Day with Jones' bass going nuts. Soundboard fragment includes six songs.\n\n1971.09.09 Hampton, Hampton Roads Coliseum\nAn incomplete show and all that is known to exist from this show in this fabulous sounding soundboard. An excellent, virtuostic show with Jones in particular shining through! His bass in Heartbreaker and Celebration Day is amazing. Stairway To Heaven is one of the closest to the album version I have heard with a great guitar solo.\n\n1972.10.02 Tokyo, Japan\nRobert's voice is still high and great but is showing signs of coming down. Dazed And Confused is a strange version ... Jimmy seems to be a measure ahead of the rest of the band and it sounds quite exciting! Jones and Bonham drive this show. Hard to find quality recordings of 1972 (good thing we have HTWWW).  This is probably the best audience recording of 1972.\n\n1973.01.22 Southampton, England\nBron-Yr-Aur Stomp was dropped out from the set for the second time during this tour. Of particular and special note is an off-hand performance of How Many More Times, which had been retired just over two years prior. You can hear the band play off of each other as they all take turns guiding the music's direction. This is a recording taken from the multi-track tapes of a professional recording by the band.\n\n1973.03.16 Vienna, Austria\nThis is one of the greatest Led Zeppelin concerts ever and Dazed and Confused here must be the best ever version, absolutely amazing. The whole band, but especially Jimmy, is just unstoppable in this show, playing with such force, guts, dynamics and passion that it must be heard to be believed. \n\n1973.03.22 Essen, Germany\nPageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar work and BonhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drumming in Dazed And Confused are both unbelievable. They pull out phrases and rhythms the like of which they hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done before and will not achieve again on this tour. Only two songs here but combined 60+ minutes!  Dazed and Confused and Whole Lotto Love Medley.  Soundboard with audience recording to fill gaps.\n\n1973.05.13 Mobile, Municipal Auditorium\nThe band is in top form and deliver one of the best from this tour. Jimmy's playing is incredibly fluent and great, especially on Misty Mountain Hop leading to Since I've Been Loving You. Over The Hills and Far Away has a few very unusual and exciting guitar passages by Mr. Pagey. Dazed And Confused is beyond description. Incomplete soundboard.\n\n1973.05.16 Houston, Sam Houston Coliseum\nSoundboard Five Songs.\n\n1973.05.18 Dallas, Memorial Auditorium\nSince I've Been Loving You is outstanding and Dazed and Confused is rather loose but very exciting, energetic and bow solo is very dark.  Incomplete Soundboard.\n\n1973.05.19 Fort Worth, Tarrant County Convention Center\nThe whole band sounds strong with some immense drumming from Bonham. Robert screeches and sounds strong and Jimmy and Jonesy steamroll through the set.  Incomplete Soundboard.\n\n1973.05.25 Denver, Denver Coliseum\nAll songs presented here are playing with passion and energy. A massive version of Heartbreaker leads to the bombastic Whole Lotta Love that contains very nice rendition of John Lee Hooker's Boogie Chillun. A hurricane Communication Breakdown closing this amazing show.  Soundboard three songs.\n\n1973.06.02 San Francisco, Cesar Stadium\nThe sound is amazing and Robert's voice is very powerful ... he screams and gets right up there for perhaps the last time in his career ... his range would be lessened on the following tours.  Soundboard five songs.\n\n1973.07.15 Buffalo, Buffalo Memorial Auditorium\nConsidered a sluggish show from Zep here it is for your inspection. Incomplete soundboard.\n\n1973.07.17 Seattle, Seattle Coliseum\nAnother of the great 1973 US Tour shows ... from the onset the band is ready to play. The improvisations, especially No Quarter and the immensely long Dazed And Confused are fresh and unique and sound very different from anything heard before. This is a matrix blending soundboard and audience recordings. The last three tracks are audience recording only.\n\n1973.07.28 New York, Madison Square Garden\nThe second show of the three night stand and the second to last of the 1973 tour, this is a very good, although somewhat loose show. Robert's voice alternates between being very strong and creaking a bit but it is surprisingly strong in Since I've Been Loving You and Stairway To Heaven. The band is playing very well, in a loose and exciting Dazed and Confused. Moby Dick is extremely long yet somewhat exciting and the last three numbers rock hard! But there's something really special with this gig - some serious excerpts are used on official movie and soundtrack; just listen to the middle section of No Quarter, Dazed And Confused and Bonham's drum solo ... fantastic!\n\n\nFeel free to share with anyone anytime anywhere.\nSeed if possible.
