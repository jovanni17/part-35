The story starts with a nude Alpine ski chase, which has to be my all time favorite opening to a novel.  The language in the book is hysterically overblown and the sex scenes are just intended to be silly.  There is a 4-5 page passage towards the beginning of the book where Agent 0008, Trevor Anderson, just deals with his female co-agents breasts.  Knowles had his own style in the vein of Terry Southern and some of the other post-beat writers of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s, and it was really quite funny.\n\nCheck out Permission To Kill's amazing review of this book, which I can't seem to link to, but you can get to it through this link\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blogcatalog.com/blogs/permission-to-kill.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blogcatalog.com/blogs/permission-to-kill.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor an incredible biography of William Knowles by Mr. Lynn Monroe go about halfway down the following page.  The article is called William Knowles: The Life and Death of Clyde Allison.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://efanzines.com/EK/eI7/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://efanzines.com/EK/eI7/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI have to recommend the book Gorgonzola, WonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t You Please Come Home? Which Knowles wrote under the pen name Clyde Ames.  It was written for Lancer books and I get the feeling he was paid more for writing this one or he took more time because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really the best of his spy parodys. I'll try to scan it sometime and upload it here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc78f89b7536fb006461975846365f4678a2873","amp;dn":"For+Your+Sighs+Only","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc78f89b7536fb006461975846365f4678a2873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,199,143,137,183,83,111,176,6,70,25,117,132,99,101,244,103,138,40,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
