Prison Architect is the world's latest Prison Management Sim. Starting with an empty plot of land you must construct a holding cell with basic water and electricity to house your first batch of prisoners, to buy you enough time to create a proper cell block.\n\nChange-Log \n\n= CHANGES\nNew construction material : &quot;Clear Indoor Area&quot;\nThis removes any walls and floor materials and returns them to concrete floor.\nIt only works indoors, and does not remove the external walls of the building.\nIt also removes any objects in the area.\nAdded more informative failure messages to the Reform screen, for when scheduling fails. These are common failures that were wrongly reported as &quot;NO ROOMS FOUND&quot;, leading to many bug reports\nALL ROOMS STAFF ONLY : The room must be available to the prisoners, Staff Only therefore doesn't count\nNO REGIME TIMESLOT : There must be a slot in the regime of X hours of Work time, sufficient to fit the full session in\nNO TEACHERS : You don't have any of the required teacher type\nGuards no longer hang out in the Holding Cell when they have nothing to do\nYou can now clear a regime for Max or Min sec prisoners and return to the default Normal sec regime, with a new X button in the regime window\nNarcotics continued\nThe Methadone program is no longer 'graded' in the same way as the other academic/practical programs. Success chance is now based simply on attendance. Concentration and Understanding no longer play a part\nDoubled the penalty to 'Health' grading for drug and alcohol addictions (now -4 points per addiction)\nDoubled the effect on re-offending chance of drug and alcohol addictions\nThe Methadone program has been renamed to 'Pharmacological Treatment of Drug Addiction'\nThe Alcoholics Anonymous program has been renamed to 'Alcoholics Group Therapy'\nFood ingredients will only be delivered if you have a Kitchen\nFood trays will only be delivered if you have a canteen\n= FIXED\n0002217: [AI &amp; Behaviour] 2 kitchens cause cooks to run between the two unproductively.
