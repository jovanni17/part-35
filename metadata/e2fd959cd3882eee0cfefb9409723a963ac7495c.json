I've been looking for a non Xvid encoded version for a while with no luck, my apologies for the quality.  Still an incredibly great show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2fd959cd3882eee0cfefb9409723a963ac7495c","amp;dn":"Garth+Marenghis+Darkplace+DVDrip+XviD+With+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2fd959cd3882eee0cfefb9409723a963ac7495c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,253,149,156,211,136,46,238,12,254,251,148,9,114,58,150,58,199,73,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
