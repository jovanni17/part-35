There are vehicles, faces, etc so check it out.\n\nThe files originated from www.heroturko.org and were put together by a team called media-down I think. Something like that.\n\nI only have 100k upload speed so initial seeding will take a little bit of time.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3af66e984ec943e7a385bdbe24a4dd3ec9d1532c","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Models+for+3DSMAX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3af66e984ec943e7a385bdbe24a4dd3ec9d1532c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,246,110,152,78,201,67,231,163,133,189,190,36,164,221,62,201,209,83,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
