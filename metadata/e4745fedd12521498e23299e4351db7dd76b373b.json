Long before the phrase 'The Nashville Sound' was coined, Music City USA was home to a great many Rock 'n' Roll recordings. Week after week, record companies would dispatch their latest signings to strut their stuff at the RCA Studio on Hawkins Street and Owen Bradley's Quonset Hut on 16th Avenue South. These were the facilities where future legends such as Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Gene Vincent would evince some of their finest recorded works. On hand to make sure the process went according to plan was a coterie of musicians whose country, R&amp;B and gospel roots provided the ultimate alchemy. Stuart Colman, himself a one-time resident of Nashville, has cherry-picked a prime selection of sides recorded in Music City between 1956 and 1960, many of which are extremely rare and have certainly never been on CD before. The end result is a true eye-opener. (amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nSassy Sugar -\nThe Pure Essence of Nashville Rock &amp; Roll 1956-1960\n(3CD Fab Distribution) 2011)\n\nDisc: 1\n 1.
