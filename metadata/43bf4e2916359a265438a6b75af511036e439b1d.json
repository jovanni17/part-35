This film takes an in-depth psychological examination of the organization model through various case studies. \nWhat the study illustrates is that in the its behavior, this type of &quot;person&quot; typically acts like a dangerously destructive psychopath without conscience. Furthermore, we see the profound threat this psychopath has for our world and our future, but also how the people with courage, intelligence and determination can do to stop it.  \n\n\n\nIMDB link:  URL=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379225/\n\n\n\nAlright. Let&amp;#039;s have some Q and A:\n\nQ:  Section 8, why are your mp4 releases so large? :(\n\nA:  I can spell it out real simply. They are of very high quality. They have not been resized and shrunk to a horizontal resolution of 640 like many releases. They retain their original horizontal resolution of 720. If you compare these releases to the original DVD material I think you will be hard pressed to notice a difference. The difference is transparent to the human eye. I encode my movies to be the same quality as the original material when viewed on my 92 inch HD screen.\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\nName: The Corporation.mp4\nDate: 17/07/2007 22:22:54\nSize: 1,470,994,854 bytes (1402.85 MB)\n\n[ Generic info ]\n\nPlay duration: 02:24:04 (8643.5 s)\nContainer type: MP4/MOV\nMajor brand: ISO Base Media version 1\nCreation time: 17/07/2007 02:18:23 UTC\nModification time: 17/07/2007 02:18:23 UTC\nNumber of streams: 2\nType of stream nr. 1: video (avc1) {GPAC ISO Video Handler}\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (mp4a) {GPAC ISO Audio Handler}\nAudio streams: 1\n\n[ About quality ]\n\nResolution: VERY HIGH (720 x 480)\nWidth: multiple of 16 (GOOD)\nHeight: multiple of 16 (GOOD)\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec: avc1\nResolution: 720 x 480\nFrame aspect ratio: 3:2 = 1.5\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 3:2 = 1.5\nFramerate: 29.970029 fps\nNumber of frames: 259046\nBitrate: 1227.972473 kbps\n\n[ Audio track ]\n\nCodec: mp4a\nBitrate: 129.269576 kbps\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43bf4e2916359a265438a6b75af511036e439b1d","amp;dn":"The+Corporation-SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43bf4e2916359a265438a6b75af511036e439b1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,191,78,41,22,53,154,38,84,56,166,183,90,245,17,3,110,67,155,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
