Infomercials suck UNLESS you&amp;#039;re actually interested in what they&amp;#039;re selling.  In this case, you&amp;#039;ll get a taste of squarefoot gardening.  Then you can decide if the book is worth it or not.\n\n\nThe production value is low.  The content is good... not great.  I&amp;#039;m posting it because it gave me cause to completely re-think how we set up our garden and we&amp;#039;re a bit more excited this season to try some new shit (no pun intended).\n\nDefinitely not worth buying though.  Don&amp;#039;t feel bad for a second stealing this one.\n\nCheers,\n\nMook &amp; Bee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe2a7418c4cbfeeed369346a0a7e968a5914182","amp;dn":"Squarefoot+Gardening+%5BmookANDbee%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe2a7418c4cbfeeed369346a0a7e968a5914182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,226,167,65,140,76,191,238,237,54,147,70,160,167,233,104,165,145,65,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
