Rolling, voluptuous basslines, uptight guitars, and vibrant brass sections drive tracks like Funkadelic&amp;#039;s &quot;One Nation Under a Groove,&quot; Fatback&amp;#039;s &quot;Backstrokin&amp;#039;,&quot; and Tom Browne&amp;#039;s &quot;Thighs High (Grip Your Hips and Move),&quot; bridging the gap between funk and disco and providing countless rap and hip-hop artists ample material for sampling. Sun&amp;#039;s &quot;Sun Is Here,&quot; Faze-O&amp;#039;s &quot;Riding High,&quot; and T.S. Monk&amp;#039;s &quot;Bon Bon Vie&quot; are among the other highlights of this funky, stylish compilation, which also documents just how integral these songs were to hip-hop&amp;#039;s development.
