The game is based around a war (sometime in the future) on a planet called Helios, where humans have settled. \n\nEnemy spacecraft have followed them from Earth and are attempting to exterminate the colony. Project Gunmetal is a massive operation which oversaw the creation of a supremely powerful war machine. \n\n\nThis is an exe version I put together, it's patched so that you don't need a cd in the drive.\n\nI have setup the controls for Xbox360 controller, so if you have an Xbox360 gamepad, you're all good to go.\n\nEnjoy this fun game, &amp; please seed for everyone else, cheers.\n\nWiki:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Metal_(video_game)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Metal_(video_game)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy Screens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HandoaAeH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HandoaAeH&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82478472885c8437920dc04ff5708f228f45c7bd","amp;dn":"Gun+Metal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82478472885c8437920dc04ff5708f228f45c7bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,71,132,114,136,92,132,55,146,13,192,79,245,112,143,34,143,69,199,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
