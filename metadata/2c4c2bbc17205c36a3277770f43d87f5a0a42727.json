The New Life\n\n\nNorthern Ireland: home to Snow Patrol, RihannaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boob-based farm scandal, and what was, for 30 years until 1998, BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only fully functioning civil war. What the country really isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t famed for, though, is art-rock bands. YÃ¢â‚¬â„¢see, art-rock just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fly in this crunch-punk-loving province. And with their affectless post-punk and brittle C86 pop, Girls Names are about as quintessentially Ã¢â‚¬ËœNorthern IrishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as an Argentinian horse.\n\nBut listen as their debut unfolds, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in their menacing beauty and dread stillness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a band whose dark disposition has everything to do with Northern Ireland.\n\nSince the ceasefire, a new breed of artists have rejected the Ash-helmed grunge era in favour of a less simplistic vernacular better able to capture an emotionally damaged country as it heals. If noise-lords LaFaro are Belfastian defiance incarnate, and Two Door the gleaming face of The New Northern Ireland, then Girls Names are the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubled heart. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe New LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the very sound of being haunted by your past, tapping into the angst of a population struggling to move on. Ã¢â‚¬Å“How can we ever begin...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sings Cathal Cully on the title track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“...born to the bomb?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe New LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ charts the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expansion from macabre garage rockers to full-blown goth act. Draped in CullyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spectral baritone, &quot;Drawing Lines&quot; is The Wipers reduced to an ominous shimmer, while &quot;A Second Skin&quot; pits vampiric downstrokes against terror-speeding arpeggios. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s their death-obsessed garage rock writ panoramic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the sound inching on &quot;Hypnotic Regression&quot; towards the bombast of mid-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s stadium goth. Crucially, though, they never concede to caricature. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe New LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is about real life, laid bare. Austere and mistrusting of dark fairy tales, this is goth with a post-punk soul.\n\nSongs persistently subvert fancy in the name of realism. On &quot;Notion&quot;, atonal notes and dark FX embitter the sweet C86 melodies, while the remorseless synth-whirr of &quot;Occultation&quot; undercuts a resemblance to The CureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandiose &quot;Disintegration&quot;. And rather than a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsoaring finaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the eight-minute closer simply glares atop an unchanging guitar line. The title implies a yearning for better times, but if Girls NamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cinematic sweep has a romantic quality, more often than not they use bigness to dwarf CullyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice against giant, lonely vistas.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe New LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a must-listen. Not only for its seductive power, but because it feels unprecedented. Never before now have the doomy stylings of post-punk been used in the context of Northern Ireland. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe New LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sounds like a gag loosened, a voice finally unsilenced.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c4c2bbc17205c36a3277770f43d87f5a0a42727","amp;dn":"Girls+Names+-+The+New+Life+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c4c2bbc17205c36a3277770f43d87f5a0a42727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,76,43,188,23,32,92,54,163,39,119,112,244,61,135,245,160,164,39,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
