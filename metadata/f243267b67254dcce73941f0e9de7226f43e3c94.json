The Ambient Sounds Of An Audience In Waiting'' as well as the complete ''20. Intermission'', as i felt it added to the overall atmosphere of the show (for me anyway).\nThe same recording level was used throughout the entire concert, which will explain why ''01. The Ambient Sounds Of An Audience In Waiting'' and ''20. Intermission'' are lower in volume when you \nlisten to it.\n\n\n01. The Ambient Sounds Of An Audience In Waiting - (11:44)\n02.
