The girls have to follow lots of strange customs, e.g. do not eat or go to the bathroom when a boy is around. Ugly girls have two choices - being bitches and hate boys, or being generally cheap and looked down upon by everyone. The afternoons are spent on the beaches, in the backseats of car or at home-alone-parties where sex and alcohol are the main ingredients. Parents and teachers are trying to straighten the kids out, but that is not easy.\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFile Size: 568,240 KB\n\nCountry: Australia\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama\n\nRelease Date: 10 December 1981\n\nRuntime: 87 min\n\nSound Mix: Mono\n\nColor: Color\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1 \n\nDirector: Bruce Beresford \n\nWriters: Gabrielle Carey, Margaret Kelly\n\nStars: Nell Schofield, Jad Capelja, Geoff Rhoe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1de7c39324c409a4761266a44e8eff9b1babf1bb","amp;dn":"Puberty+Blues+%281981%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1de7c39324c409a4761266a44e8eff9b1babf1bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,231,195,147,36,196,9,164,118,18,102,164,78,142,255,155,27,171,241,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
