Of course he is deeply rooted in the Indian tradition, so it is no surprise to see that collaborations also took place with the glitterati of Indian musical society ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ his mother, Shobha Gurtu, Zakir Hussain, L. Shankar, Shankar Mahadevan, Hariprasad Chaurasia, The Misra Brothers and Sultan Khan. World music has become an established genre in which Trilok has further ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œploughed his own furrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with his own group, to great effect, performing and recording with Salif Keita, Oumou Sangare, Angelique Kidjo, Neneh Cherry, Omara Portuondo, Tuvan throat singers, Huun Huur Tu, to such effect that . Rita Ray of BBC Radio described him as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa serial collaboratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nIn 2006/7, Trilok has recorded and performed with the Malian musicians from the Frikywa Family and the Italian, Arke String Quartet. Although these performances continue, he has also formed a World Music group featuring Bass, Guitar, Violin, Didjeridoo and Santoor which showcases his talents thru the coming seasons. He will also offer his Twenty Years of Talking Tabla a solo event focussing on speech and tabla, with a chance for small audiences to exchange musical views with him and learn about his broad compositional techniques.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
