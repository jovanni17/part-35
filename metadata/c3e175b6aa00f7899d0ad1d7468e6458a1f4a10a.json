When her fog of sleep clears, she finds her world is suddenly, irretrievably shattered: Her husband, Brendan, has committed suicide.\n\nThe first few hours following NoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devastating discovery pass for her in a blur of numbness and disbelief. Then, a disturbing awareness slowly settles in: Brendan left no note and gave no indication that he was contemplating taking his own life. Why would a rock-solid police officer with unwavering affection for his wife, job, and quaint hometown suddenly choose to end it all? Having spent a lifetime avoiding hard truths, Nora must now start facing them.\n\nUnraveling her late husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final days, Nora searches for an explanationÃ¢â‚¬â€but finds a bewildering resistance from BrendanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend and partner, his fellow police officers, and his brittle mother. It quickly becomes clear to Nora that she is asking questions no one wants to answer. For beneath the soft cover of snow lies a powerful conspiracy that will stop at nothing to keep its presence unknown . . . and its darkest secrets hidden.\n\nRuin Falls \n\nIn a suspenseful follow-up to her critically acclaimed Cover of Snow, Jenny Milchman ratchets up the tension with this edge-of-your-seat story of a mother determined to find her missing children.\n\nLiz Daniels has every reason to be happy about setting off on a rare family vacation, leaving their remote home in the Adirondack Mountains behind for a while. Instead, she feels uneasy. Her children, eight-year-old Reid and six-year-old Ally, have only met their paternal grandparents a handful of times. But Liz's husband, Paul, has decided that, despite a strained relationship with his mother and father, they should visit the farm in western New York where he spent his childhood.\n\nOn their way to the farm, the family stops at a hotel for the night. In the morning, when Liz checks on her sleeping children, all of her anxiety from the day before comes roaring back to life: Ally and Reid are nowhere to be found. Blind panic slides into ice-cold terror as the hours tick by without anyone finding a trace of the kids. Soon, Paul and Liz are being interviewed by police, an Amber Alert is issued, and detectives are called in.\n\n\nFrantic worry and helplessness threaten to overtake LizÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mindÃ¢â‚¬â€but in a sudden, gut-wrenching instant she realizes that it was no stranger who slipped into the hotel room that night. Someone she trusted completely has betrayed her. Though she knows that Ally and Reid are safe, Liz will stop at nothing to find them and get them back. From her guarded in-lawsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ unwelcoming farmhouse to the deep woods of her own hometown, Liz follows the threads of a terrible secret to uncover a hidden world created from dreams and haunted by nightmares.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3e175b6aa00f7899d0ad1d7468e6458a1f4a10a","amp;dn":"Jenny+Milchman+-+2+Novels+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3e175b6aa00f7899d0ad1d7468e6458a1f4a10a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,225,117,182,170,0,247,137,157,10,209,215,70,142,100,88,161,244,161,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
