Rare black\n             American music from the 1970s and 80s.\n\nIt's been a few years since the last ÃƒÂ´SuperFunkÃƒÂ¶ compilation, and in\n    that time there has been a marked change in the world of funk\ncollecting. In searching for a new sound, something that hasn't been\nplayed before, the rare soul scene has developed a taste for funkier\nrhythms. Some of the newly popular records had been big with the funk\n crowd a decade earlier, while others had in the past been rejected\n    for one reason or another. Another category involves records\npreviously considered too soulful for fans of heavy James Brown-style\n  funk and too funky for the soul world. While soul clubs have not\ncompletely change their playlists, these emissaries from the world of\n       funk have certainly perked up their musical selection.\n\nDemand for these types of records has been fuelled by a younger crowd\n   who cut their teeth in less-structured club scenes that happily\n played funk and R&amp;B alongside more traditional forms of soul. Clubs\n like these attract a whole new audience to the music. On the first\n  and third Saturday of every month, for example, over 1500 people,\n  mainly under 25s, flock to South London Soul Train in Peckham to\n    dance to a playlist dominated by funky sounds. In this age of\n  digitised, streamed, pre-packaged music, it is a sight that is as\n                   surprising as it is wonderful.\n\n  Our latest ÃƒÂ´SuperFunkÃƒÂ¶ collection is informed by the more soulful\nside of things. That isn't to say we have ignored our roots; none of\nthe tracks here would sound out of place at Deep Funk or South London\n   Soul Train. The 20 cuts we have put together include in-demand\n rarities, previously unreleased gems, a smattering of classics and\nmore than a few obscurities that are due their time in the spotlight.\n       All in all, this is soulful funky music at its finest.\n\n[ SiTES ]\n\nIf you don't know, you probably shouldn't anyway...\n\n[ REGARDS ]\n\n2DB * AAF * AMOK * APC * BPM * DS * EGO * EiTheLMP3 * iDC * JUST\n         KSi * MTC * SND * MiL * MOD * NBD * NmE * NUHS\n                  PULSE * RNS * REV * UTE * WLM\n                   oDDiTy * DeMoN * Razor 1911\n       Superior Art Creations * Chemical Reaction Project\n      ...and all others who make the mp3-scene a better place\n\n[ CONTACT ]\n\nAre you a promoripper/supplier or a DJ?... apply now!\n\nplease contact us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9fe8fee7f2efacdff7eaecf7b1fcf0f2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nNfo Header + Layout by Ferrex of Superior Art Creations\n\nCreated with Nf0 prepare v2.18, by: _Ntr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af82687aa1096e4012b83db7cc2f93d82498b340","amp;dn":"VA-Soul_Emissaries_SuperFunk-CDA-2015-wAx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af82687aa1096e4012b83db7cc2f93d82498b340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,130,104,122,161,9,110,64,18,184,61,183,204,47,147,216,36,152,179,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
