Focus is on mathematical modeling, numerical simulation, experimental validation and visualization in engineering sciences. In particular, the following topics are presented: constitutive models and their implementation into finite element codes, numerical models in nonlinear elasto-dynamics including seismic excitations, multiphase models in structural engineering and multiscale models of materials systems, sensitivity and reliability analysis of engineering structures, the application of scientific computing in urban water management and hydraulic engineering, and the application of genetic algorithms for the registration of laser scanner point clouds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2267145023eea5fa02823c8af88ae2e9386ab7ef","amp;dn":"Computational+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2267145023eea5fa02823c8af88ae2e9386ab7ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,103,20,80,35,238,165,250,2,130,60,138,248,138,226,233,56,106,183,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
