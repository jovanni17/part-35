Topics range from ruminations on why Charles Dickens was among the best of writers and the worst of men to the haunting science fiction of J.G. Ballard; from the enduring legacies of Thomas Jefferson and George Orwell to the persistent agonies of anti-Semitism and jihad.\n\nHitchens even looks at the recent financial crisis and argues for the enduring relevance of Karl Marx. The book forms a bridge between the two parallel enterprises of culture and politics. It reveals how politics justifies itself by culture, and how the latter prompts the former. In this fashion, Arguably burnishes Christopher Hitchens' credentials as - to quote Christopher Buckley - our &quot;greatest living essayist in the English language.&quot;\n\n\nRip notes:\n\nConverted from AA to 96k VBR mp3 then gapless split into 5 minute chunks.\n\nComments are greatly appreciated and : Please Seed!\n\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1574b150629349d976603902824d72e5b575a83","amp;dn":"Arguably%3A+Essays+by+Christopher+Hitchens++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1574b150629349d976603902824d72e5b575a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,87,75,21,6,41,52,157,151,102,3,144,40,36,215,46,91,87,90,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
