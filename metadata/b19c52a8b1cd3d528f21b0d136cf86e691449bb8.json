Groves\n\nPublisher: Manning | 2013 | ISBN: 978-1-61729-114-2 | 296 pages\n\nAOP in .NET introduces aspect-oriented programming and provides guidance on how to get the most practical benefit from this technique. The book's many examples concentrate on modularizing non-functional requirements that often sprawl throughout object-oriented projects. You'll appreciate its straightforward introduction using familiar C#-based examples.\n\nThis book requires no prior experience with AOP. Readers should know C# or another OO language.\n\n\n    Clear and simple introduction to AOP\n    Maximum benefit with minimal theory\n    PostSharp and Castle DynamicProxy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b19c52a8b1cd3d528f21b0d136cf86e691449bb8","amp;dn":"AOP+in+.NET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b19c52a8b1cd3d528f21b0d136cf86e691449bb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,156,82,168,177,205,61,82,143,33,176,209,54,207,134,230,145,68,155,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
