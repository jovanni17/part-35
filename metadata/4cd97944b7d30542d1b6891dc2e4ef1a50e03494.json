When they are opened... nightmares becomes reality&quot;. That's according to the introduction of this series which dramatizes the &quot;true&quot; stories of people who have been haunted.\n\n\nIn this docudrama, the actual people who have experienced the paranormal recount their stories on-camera, as the frightening events of their stories are re-enacted. (Fearing ridicule, some of the witnesses are shown only in silhouette.) Filmed in a very cinematic style, &quot;A Haunting&quot; sets out to frighten, providing a few genuine chills in most episodes. \n\n\nMany of the stories contain common elements (moving into an old house where people have died, spirits attaching themselves to young children) and a predictable ending (spirit possession, or as often as not, the staging of an exorcism.)\n&quot;A Haunting&quot; began as two specials (&quot;Connecticut&quot; and &quot;Georgia&quot;) before being turned into a series.\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by:  Anthony Call\n==========================\n\n\nProduced by: Larry Silverman\n============================\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: A Haunting\nYear.................: 2005-2007\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:49:32 (  ) 00:49:38 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 640x368\nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1007 kbit/s ( ) 1028 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: (N/A)\nFile Size:...........: 349 MB ( ) 350 MB\nFPS..................: 23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 2005-2007\nParts................: 39 Episodes\n\n\n \n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484243/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484243/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484243/episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0484243/episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n    EPISODES:\n    =========\n\n\n    *Season 1*\n\n  1) The Lake Club Horror  \n  2) The Haunting of Summerwind\n  3) Hell House\n  4) Cursed\n  5) Echoes from the Grave\n  6) Darkness Follows\n\n\n\n\n    *Season 2*\n\n  1) Gateway to Hell\n  2) The Diabolical\n  3) Demon Child\n  4) Sallie's House\n  5) Hungry Ghosts\n  6) Where Demons Dwell\n  7) Ghost Soldier\n  8) House of the Dead\n  9) Dark Forest\n 10) A Haunting in Florida\n\n\n\n\n    *Season 3*\n \n  1) Fear House\n  2) The Attic\n  3) Hidden Terror\n  4) The Unleashed\n  5) A Haunting in Ireland\n  6) The Forgotten\n  7) The Wheatsheaf Horror\n  8) The Possessed\n  9) The Presence\n 10) The Dark Side\n\n\n\n\n    *Season 4*\n\n  1) Dark Wrath\n  2) The Awakening\n  3) The Calling\n  4) The Apartment\n  5) Spirits of the Dead\n  6) Where Evil Lurks\n  7) Spellbound\n  8) Echoes of the Past\n  9) Ghost Hunter\n 10) Stalked by Evil\n 11) Casa de los Muertos\n 12) Monster in the Apartment\n 13) Legend Trippers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click on DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) on my older torrents instead,thank you.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cd97944b7d30542d1b6891dc2e4ef1a50e03494","amp;dn":"A+Haunting+%5BComplete+Set-All+4+Seasons%5D-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cd97944b7d30542d1b6891dc2e4ef1a50e03494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,217,121,68,183,211,5,66,209,182,137,29,194,228,239,26,80,224,52,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
