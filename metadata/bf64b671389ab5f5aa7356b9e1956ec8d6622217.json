It combines the features of our award winning products, Registry Mechanic and Privacy Guardian to ensure that you have the range of tools at your fingertips to ensure optimal system performance, stability and user privacy.\n\n[+] Click to Enlarge\nRegistry Cleaner\n\nWith Desktop Maestro, you can safely clean, repair and optimize the WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® registry with a few simple mouse clicks. Problems with the WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® registry are a common cause of WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® crashes, slow performance and error messages. Desktop Maestro uses a high-performance detection algorithm to quickly identify missing and invalid references in your WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® registry. These problems can occur for many reasons including incorrect or incomplete removal of software, missing or corrupt hardware drivers and orphaned startup programs. Within a few easy steps, Desktop Maestro will scan your entire registry for any invalid entries and list the registry errors found so you can choose to selectively clean each item or automatically repair all errors. Desktop Maestro can also make a backup of any repairs made so that you can easily recover any changes if required.\n\nLearn more about the importance of a clean registry with our registry insight.\nPrivacy Protection\n\nThe Privacy Guardian feature of Desktop Maestro guarantees your privacy by ensuring that all traces of your online and computer activities are permanently erased and unrecoverable on your PC. Information from every website you visit is stored on your computer and recorded in hidden WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® locations including temporary files, cookies, system registry and the index.dat file. Web browsers only provide partial privacy protection by allowing some temporary internet files and cookies to be deleted, but Privacy Guardian also cleans data out of all the hidden files and deletes the data securely. It also frees valuable hard drive space and speeds up system performance by cleaning old and unused temporary records. It allows you to simply and securely erase sensitive files from WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Microsoft Office, Netscape, WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Media Player and Internet Explorer.\nSystem Optimization\n\nDesktop Maestro provides optimization and performance features that allow you to actively monitor system usage, processes, CPU, memory and disk space. The registry compacting feature analyzes, rebuilds and compacts the WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Registry by removing registry gaps and free space, and corrupt keys thereby making your PC start-up quicker and with more available memory. The system optimization function applies a set of tweaks and patches directly onto your PC that are designed to improve system performance and usability.
