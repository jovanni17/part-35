Timmerman\nTorrent file name: Dark Forces (Kenneth R. Timmerman) Retail epub [Itzy]\nPublisher: Broadside Books (June 24, 2014)\nSold by: HarperCollins Publishers\nGenre: Non-fiction, Politics, Government, Terrorism\nFormat: Retail .epub\n\nThe New York Times bestselling author of Shadow Warriors investigates the tragedy of Benghazi to answer the questions: what really happenedÃ¢â‚¬â€and why?\n\nWe know the Obama administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, of a demonstration caused by an Internet movie that went out of control. But what actually did happen in Benghazi on the night of September 11, 2012?\n\nDark Forces is the story of clandestine arms deliveries by the United States and its allies to Libya that wound up in the hands of Islamist guerrillas. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a story of a romantic diplomat, in love with the Middle East and with a mystical version of Islam. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a story of bald-faced lies, heroic acts, and the deepest corruption.\n\nBut Dark Forces is not only a retelling of events. It puts those events into the larger context of Obama administration policy toward the Middle East. It will examine the administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record of systematically supporting Muslim Brotherhood and extremist groups in their efforts to overthrow pro-U.S. autocrats in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.\n\nIt shows how President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obsessive outreach to the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran led the Iranian regime to dismiss him as a weak, ineffective leader who would not fight back. And it shows why and how this deadly combination cost the lives of four Americans on Sept. 11, 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a956e3021231b884d51e43722f0ac1f787ec7e64","amp;dn":"Dark+Forces+%28Kenneth+R.+Timmerman%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a956e3021231b884d51e43722f0ac1f787ec7e64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,86,227,2,18,49,184,132,213,30,67,114,47,10,193,247,135,236,126,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
