HMAS Toowoomba finally gets the     \n     call it's been waiting for and races to the scene. The boarding     \n    teams apprehend a skiff. A tense search reveals the men are armed    \n   to the teeth with automatic weapons and a rocket grenade launcher.    \n    Meanwhile, helicopter Pegasus is grounded and is unable to assist    \n     with long-range reconnaissance, boarding operations, or even a      \n    routine RAS replenishment-at-sea. Just over halfway through their    \n   six-month mission the crew are homesick and struggling to maintain    \n   morale. To make matters worse a young officer commits the cardinal    \n   sin of falling asleep at the wheel. He receives a severe reprimand    \n    from Commander Ingham who is adamant that all his crew perform at    \n     their best.
