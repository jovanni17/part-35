His subsequent workÃ¢â‚¬â€five novels, another story collection, and two books of nonfictionÃ¢â‚¬â€continued to bring extraordinary praise and national attention to the writer New York Newsday called a &quot;master.&quot;\n\nIn November 2004, Brown sent the nearly completed manuscript of his sixth novel to his literary agent. A week later, he died of a massive heart attack. He was fifty-three years old.\n\nA Miracle of Catfish is that novel. Brown's trademarksÃ¢â‚¬â€his raw detail, pared-down prose, and characters under siegeÃ¢â‚¬â€are all here. \n\nThis beautiful, heartbreaking anthem to the writer's own North Mississippi land and the hard-working, hard-loving, hard-losing men it spawns is the story of one year in the lives of five charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€an old farmer with a new pond he wants stocked with baby catfish; a bankrupt fish pond stocker who secretly releases his forty-pound brood catfish into the farmer's pond; a little boy from the trailer home across the road who inadvertently hooks the behemoth catfish; the boy's inept father; and a former convict down the road who kills a second time to save his daughter.\n\nThat Larry Brown died so young, and before he could see A Miracle of Catfish published, is a tragedy. That he had time to enrich the legacy of his work with this remarkable book is a blessing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b99fc85c891b61f001d12a0a7a31bc3558f0421d","amp;dn":"A+Miracle+of+Catfish+by+larry+Brown+%5BretailEPUB%5D+%28MOBI+AZW3+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b99fc85c891b61f001d12a0a7a31bc3558f0421d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,159,200,92,137,27,97,240,1,209,42,10,122,49,188,53,88,240,66,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
