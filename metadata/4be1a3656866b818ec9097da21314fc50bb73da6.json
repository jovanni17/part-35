All these will find it a pleasure to have this learning pack in their BitTorrent client.\nIt is a timely publication in that it not only helps those who already had a reason to learn the language, it will also arouse the interest of those who may have had occasion to come across it.\n\nWe wish it every success!\n\nDr. Ugo Mifsud Bonnici\n\n5th President of the Republic of Malta","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4be1a3656866b818ec9097da21314fc50bb73da6","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Maltese+Learning+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4be1a3656866b818ec9097da21314fc50bb73da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,225,163,101,104,102,184,24,236,144,151,218,33,49,79,197,11,183,61,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
