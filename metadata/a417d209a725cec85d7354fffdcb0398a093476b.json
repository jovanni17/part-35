An increasingly bluesy flavor began to color the \nsongwriting and arrangements, especially on the party&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;booze anthem &quot;Roadhouse \nBlues.&quot; Airy mysticism was still present on &quot;Waiting for the Sun,&quot; &quot;Queen of the \nHighway,&quot; and &quot;Indian Summer&quot;; &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; and &quot;Land Ho!&quot; struck effective \nbalances between the hard rock arrangements and the narrative reach of the \nlyrics. &quot;Peace Frog&quot; was the most political and controversial track, documenting \nthe domestic unrest of late-&amp;#039;60s America before unexpectedly segueing into the \nrestful ballad &quot;Blue Sunday.&quot; &quot;The Spy,&quot; by contrast, was a slow blues that \npointed to the direction that would fully blossom on L.A. Woman. \n\nOriginally released as part of the completed recorded works 2006 box set \nPerception, this deluxe edition of Morrison Hotel is a double-disc set \ncontaining one CD featuring a newly remastered version of the album with bonus \ntracks and a DVD with a 5.1 Surround mix, bonus video footage, and a photo \ngallery. Given that the Doors catalog was remastered just seven years before \nthis box, the sonics of these 2006s remasters are noticeable but not radically \ndifferent -- the kind of subtle remastering that is significant to audiophiles \nwho know this music intimately. This reissue contains a whopping ten bonus \ntracks: four of these may be alternate takes of &quot;Roadhouse Blues,&quot; but there&amp;#039;s \nthe brief snippets of &quot;Talking Blues&quot; and &quot;Money Beats Soul,&quot; a really ragged \nand short version of Chuck Berry&amp;#039;s &quot;Carol,&quot; false starts of &quot;Peace Frog,&quot; and \nalternate versions of &quot;The Spy&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Highway.&quot; On the video side, \nthere are music videos of &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; and &quot;Wild Child.&quot; Apart from the \ngenuine alternate takes, most of the bonus material feels like scraps, but they \ndon&amp;#039;t hurt this deluxe edition, which ultimately lives up to its title: this is \nthe best-sounding, best-presented reissue of this album yet.\n\n\nAbout the album (from Wikipedia)\n\nMorrison Hotel (sometimes referred to as Hard Rock Cafe from the title of the \nfirst side of the LP, whose second side is titled Morrison Hotel) is The Doors&amp;#039; \nfifth album. It was released in 1970. After their experimental work The Soft \nParade was not as well received as anticipated, the group went back to basics \nand back to their roots. On this album, there is a slight steer toward blues, \nwhich would be fully explored by the band on their next album, L.A. Woman. The \nstrategy worked; even though no major hit singles were drawn from the album, \nMorrison Hotel reestablished The Doors as favorites of the critics, and when \nthey followed with L.A. Woman the next year, they were rewarded with two more US \nTop 20 hits.\n\nAdditional musicians include harmonica whiz G. Puglese (aka John Sebastian) and \nblues master Lonnie Mack on bass.\n\nThe cover photo was taken at the actual Morrison Hotel located at 1246 South \nHope Street in Los Angeles. The band asked the owners if they could photograph \nthe hotel and they declined, so the band went inside when nobody was looking and \ntook the photograph.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nROADHOUSE BLUES\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoadhouse BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ opens up the Doors fifth studio LP with the band firing on all \ncylinders. Although Morrison Hotel was touted as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“bluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ album, this tune is \none of the few tracks that fully bear that statement to fruition. Likewise, Jim \nMorrison had not yet lost his erotic bravado and magnetic arrogant swagger -- \nwhich he indeed exudes throughout the album, especially here. Augmenting the \nquartet are legendary blues guitarist Lonnie Mack -- who is uncharacteristically \nsporting a bass on this recording -- and some mean Chicago-style harp blowinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ \nfrom one G. Puglese -- who is better known as former LovinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Spoonful leader John \nB. Sebastian.\n\nMorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics -- while perfectly matched to the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bar room/college dorm \natmosphere -- seem atypically negligible at first. However, below that veneer \nlies some of his most authentically sexually charged images -- true to the \nspirit of both Morrison and the blues. Lines such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYeah, the back of the \nroadhouse/they got some bungalows/And ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s For The People who Like To Go Down \nSlowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and the prototypical blues howl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got to roll, roll, roll/YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve \ngot to thrill my soul, all rightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ simultaneously hearken back to the basics of \nblues, yet retain a unique sense of MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inimitable poetry. \nInstrumentally, between Robbie KriegerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stinging guitar inflections and \naccents, and winding through Ray ManzarekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s full throttle piano pounding, the \ncohesive nature of the Doors as a musical unit may have been arguably equalled, \nbut never surpassed their efforts on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoadhouse BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nThe song quickly became a performance favourite and was revived for the series \nof post-Miami concerts as well. The archival Live in Detroit (Cobo Hall, \n05/08/1970) (2000) features a fiery version as does the Bright Midnight: Live in \nAmerica sampler which contains an incendiary performance from Boston. \n\nThe song took two days to record (November 4th-5th, 1969), producer Paul A. \nRothchild striving for perfection. Several takes from these sessions were \nincluded on the new 2006 remastered album. Rothchild can be heard instructing \nthe band members on their musicianship, notably when he exclaims to Robbie \nKrieger about his introductory guitar riff that &quot;we&amp;#039;re going to the roadhouse, \nRobbie, not the bathroom!&quot; Surprisingly, he does not comment on Morrison, who is \napparently intoxicated, &quot;going into full blues singer mode&quot; in the words of \nengineer Bruce Botnick, improvising and simultaneously flubbing several lyrics \nand repeating the blues phrase &quot;Money beats soul every time&quot;. The sessions only \ntook off on the second day, when resident Elektra guitarist Lonnie Mack joined \nin on bass and harmonicist John Sebastian (appearing under the pseudonym G. \nPuglese out of loyalty to his recording contract or to avoid affiliation with \nThe Doors after the Miami controversy) joined in on the sessions and Ray \nManzarek switched from his Wurlitzer electric piano to a tack piano (the same \nused on The Beach Boys &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;). One classic moment is when Morrison \nshouts &quot;Do it, Lonnie! Do it!&quot; when Mack rips off the solo. Mack was playing \nbass on that song and had borrowed Krieger&amp;#039;s guitar to develop some blues guitar \nlines. Kreiger copied some of Mack&amp;#039;s lines in later takes. No one really knows \nwhose take made it on the final cut. An interesting fact about this song is that \nMorrison has used few Nepalese words in his lyrics.The song took two days to \nrecord (November 4th-5th, 1969), producer Paul A.

An interesting fact about this song is that Morrison has used few \nNepalese words in his lyrics.\n\n\nPEACE FROG\n\nIt was released on vinyl in February 1970 by Elektra/Asylum Records and produced \nby Paul Rothchild. The song blends seamlessly into the next track on the album, \n&quot;Blue Sunday&quot;, so radio stations often play the two songs consecutively.\n\nThis funky, kinetic song is one of those tracks that will constantly amaze. On \nthis classic Doors track, Morrison touches on points of unrest, &quot;the blood on \nthe streets&quot; that overtakes different cities: Chicago, Venice, &quot;fantastic L.A.,&quot; \nand New Haven. New Haven? Well, New Haven was one of the cities where Morrison \nwas arrested in 1969. Despite the title, the Doors not surprisingly don&amp;#039;t offer \nany solutions to the problems raised here. But then again if they did they might \nhave come off weird. In fact, &quot;Peace Frog,&quot; like most Doors songs, has the group \nall but reveling in disarray. After the polyrhythmic attack comes a kind of \nmeditation. As the music quiets, Morrison begins the passage, &quot;Indians scattered \non dawn&amp;#039;s highway, bleeding to death, ghosts crowd the child&amp;#039;s fragile eggshell \nmind,&quot; which recalls an incident in his childhood that affected him deeply. Like \nmany Doors songs, no matter how far out Morrison&amp;#039;s lyrics were, the band was \nthere to support him. Robby Krieger in particular does great terse and bluesy \nlines throughout. Ray Manzarek&amp;#039;s eerie keyboards add to the chaos as usual. \n\n&quot;Peace Frog&quot; was originally called &quot;Abortion Stories&quot;; guitarist Robby Krieger \ngave the song its more tame title, &quot;Peace Frog.&quot; The bloody images (There&amp;#039;s \nblood in the streets, it&amp;#039;s up to my ankles/There&amp;#039;s blood on the streets, it&amp;#039;s up \nto my knee, etc.) originated, like many songs of The Doors, from the poetry of \nJim Morrison, including &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot; on the album Waiting for the \nSun and &quot;The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)&quot; on L.A. Woman.\n\nThe line &quot;Indians scattered on dawn&amp;#039;s highway bleeding/Ghosts crowd the young \nchild&amp;#039;s fragile eggshell mind&quot; originates from his poem, &quot;Ghost Song,&quot; that \ndescribes an event that occurred when he was young. As Morrison described it in \nAn American Prayer:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMe and my ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ mother and father ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a grandmother and a grandfather ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were \ndriving through the desert, at dawn, and a truck load of Indian workers had \neither hit another car, or just ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I don&amp;#039;t know what happened ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but there were \nIndians scattered all over the highway, bleeding to death.&quot;\n\n&quot;So the car pulls up and stops. That was the first time I tasted fear. I musta&amp;#039; \nbeen about four ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ like a child is like a flower, his head is floating in the \nbreeze, man.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe opening scene of Oliver Stone&amp;#039;s movie The Doors portrays this memory of \nMorrison&amp;#039;s.\n\nThe phrase &quot;Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven&quot; was Morrison&amp;#039;s \nreference to the police in New Haven, Connecticut.  He had been arrested there \nwhile on stage for taunting them. Since the concert was abruptly ended after \nMorrison&amp;#039;s abrupt departure, a riot ensued that spilled from the New Haven Arena \n(since razed) into the streets.\n\nThis song was being played by many US troops during the invasion of Cambodia in \n1970. The Pol Pot regime adapted this song while it invaded Cambodia in 1975\n\n\nSHIP OF FOOLS\n\nIs a poetic musical paradox. Contrasting the trackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s buoyant syncopated rhythms \nare Jim MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics, occupying the familiar terrain between creation and \ndemise. As musicians, John Densmore (drums), Robbie Krieger (guitar), Ray \nManzarek (keyboards) and former Don Ellis Orchestra member and session stalwart \nRay Neopolitan (bass) immediately lock into a tight, jazzy percolating riff -- \nwhich is abandoned for a 2/4 beat once MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals begin.\n\nAs the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s draw to a close, Morrison captures a somewhat apocalyptic overview \nregarding the conclusion of the era -- ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe human race was dying out/no one left \nto scream and shoutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. He balances that with the hope and prospect of seeking new \nhorizons -- ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPeople walking on the moonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- only to reinforce his initial \nnihilistic observations with the line ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsmog will get you pretty soon.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe second verse is an apt poetic reflection of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s counterculture -- \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEveryone was hanging out/Hanging up and hanging down/Hanging in and holding \nfastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Once again, Morrison counteracts with the optimistic line ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHope our \nlittle world will lastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nAfter a brief improvisational interlude the band once again corral behind \nMorrison as he unifies some obvious religious and secular imagery in the verse \nwhich begins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlong came Mr. Goodtrips/Looking for a new shipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nThe Doors performed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShip Of FoolsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sporadically throughout their sets in 1970. \nThe concert arrangement sticks pretty close to the original. However, the \ninstrumental break is extended, allowing the trio a chance to connect with some \nhighly innovative jazz progressions. Inspired live readings can be found on both \nthe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive In New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ disc of the Doors Box Set (1997), as well as the Live in \nDetroit (2000) archival release.\n\n\nQUEEN OF THE HIGHWAY\n\nIt is the ninth, and third-to-last track on that album. The lyrics were written \nby lead singer Jim Morrison and are believed to be about his girlfriend Pamela \nCourson, with the lines &quot;She was a princess / Queen of the Highway&quot; referring to \nher, the &quot;He was a Monster / Black dressed in leather&quot; being a description of \nJim Morrison himself, and the &quot;I hope it can continue / Just a little while \nlonger&quot; lines being perhaps, as suggested in No One Here Gets Out Alive, a \n&quot;sardonic reference to their troubled love&quot;.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInfo taken from allmusicguide and wikipedia\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a417d209a725cec85d7354fffdcb0398a093476b","amp;dn":"The+Doors+-+Morrison+Hotel+%28Perception+Box+DVD%29+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a417d209a725cec85d7354fffdcb0398a093476b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,23,210,9,167,37,206,200,93,115,84,255,253,203,3,152,160,147,71,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
