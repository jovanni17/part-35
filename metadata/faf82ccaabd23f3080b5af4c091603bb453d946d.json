But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing particularly Heafy-esque about the song. Really, if no one told me that Heafy was involved, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never know it. This just sounds like every other DragonForce song to me. You probably already know if you think thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good thing or a bad thing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf82ccaabd23f3080b5af4c091603bb453d946d","amp;dn":"DragonForce+-+Defenders+%28DEMO%29+NEW+SONG%21+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf82ccaabd23f3080b5af4c091603bb453d946d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,248,44,202,171,210,63,48,128,181,175,76,9,22,3,187,69,61,148,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
