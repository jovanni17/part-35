She was adopted and brought up to be a \nmissionary by the larger-than-life Mrs Winterson. But Jeanette followed a \ndifferent path: she found literature, fell in love with a girl, and escaped to \nuniversity. \n\nFollowing her recent memoir Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal, Jeanette \nWinterson tells the story of her recent breakdown and suicide attempt, her \nquest to find her birth mother and how the power of books helped her to \nsurvive.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7095acea22da0878beed3b7b48b58c18dfe9f4e1","amp;dn":"BBC+Imagine+-+Winter+2012+Jeanette+Winterson%2C+My+Monster+And+Me+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7095acea22da0878beed3b7b48b58c18dfe9f4e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,149,172,234,34,218,8,120,190,237,59,123,72,181,140,24,223,233,244,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
