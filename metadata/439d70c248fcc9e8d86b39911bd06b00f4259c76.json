The Gathering \nis a deeply insightful family saga, steeped in secrets and intrigue, \nunfolding over three generations. \n\nAmazon.com Review \nAmazon Significant Seven, November 2007: Pretty early on in The Gathering you realize that in her lingering portrait of the Hegarty clan (and this isn&amp;#039;t hyperbole--they are a family of 12), Irish novelist Anne Enright will wrestle with all the giant literary tropes that have come before her. Family, of course, is the big one, but with equal intensity she explores death and dying, the sea and its siren song, sex, shame, secrecy, unreliable memories, madness, &quot;the drink,&quot; and--always in the shadows--England. That said, it&amp;#039;s not like any other novel about the Irish that I&amp;#039;ve read. The story of the Hegartys is indeed bleak, and hard, but it surges with tenderness and eloquent thought which, in the end, are the very things that help this family (or at least her narrator Veronica) survive. Through her eyes, and in Enright&amp;#039;s skillful imagination, those small turning-point moments of life that we all know in some form or another--a petty fight, a careless word, an event witnessed--come together in an unshakeable vision of how you become the person you are. --Anne Bartholomew \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:439d70c248fcc9e8d86b39911bd06b00f4259c76","amp;dn":"Anne+Enright+-+The+Gathering+%28Winner+2007+Man+Booker+Prize%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"439d70c248fcc9e8d86b39911bd06b00f4259c76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,157,112,194,72,252,201,232,216,107,57,145,27,208,107,0,244,37,156,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
