Though certainly In C garners more performances and it's elegant concept is immediately attractive, Salome is a more profound work and shows the composer off in his most intersting guise.\n\nSalome was commissioned by the Kronos Quartet, who perform it here. Like many of Riley's pieces, Salome has an intricate program, involving elements from world mythology. Briefly, Salome is charged with descending to the spirit world to recover peace for humanity. The mythos is typical Riley...everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into his hippy mix. While the program is interesting, the work stands on it's own merits.
