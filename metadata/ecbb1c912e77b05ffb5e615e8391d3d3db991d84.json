They return with him to Defiance, where Yewell examines him and pronounces him normal; however McClintock suffers a vision incorporating Indogenes and reacts with some discomfort. Amanda and the new Earth Republic representative meet again; he offers her a position with the Earth Government in New York and it is revealed that they had a previous relationship. Stahma and Kenya continue their relationship; Kenya tries to avoid Datak as a client, but Stahma counsels her not to refuse him. Nolan, Amanda and McClintock visit Rafe McCawley, attempting to acclimate the astronaut to the terraformed Earth; McClintock suffers another vision and attacks Amanda. While locked in the cell at the Lawkeeper's station, he begins to harm himself and bleeds silver; Nolan realizes something is wrong and confronts Yewell, who reveals that McClintock is actually an Indogene modified to appear human and implanted with the original McClintock's memories, intended to serve as a spy and an assassin by the Votans before their arrival. The McClintock Indogene seizes Nolan's gun and escapes; he meets McCawley in the mines and apparently commits suicide, although it is later revealed that he leaves Defiance to reunite with McClintock's widow. The Earth Representative warns Amanda that she is in danger; the Earth Republic wants her out of Defiance and will use any means necessary to remove her. Nolan confronts Yewell about his involvement in the Indogene spy program, but they are interrupted by the arrival of multiple humans suffering from a hemorrhagic fever.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecbb1c912e77b05ffb5e615e8391d3d3db991d84","amp;dn":"Defiance+S01E08+XviD+%5BJKS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecbb1c912e77b05ffb5e615e8391d3d3db991d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,187,28,145,46,119,176,95,251,94,97,94,131,145,211,211,219,153,29,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
