Combining key elements from the fields of geometry, trigonometry, and linear algebra, you will learn about the core game mathematics used by all game developers to make realistic computer games. \n\nWhat will I learn if I take this course? \n\nYou will learn how to use mathematics to solve challenging problems in game development. The math for games lessons cover the following topics: \nSet Theory and Functions \nPolynomials \nTrigonometry \nVector Mathematics \nMatrix Mathematics \nQuaternion Algebra \nLinear Transformations \nAnalytic Geometry \n\n\nWho should take the course? \n\nStudying the math in video games is an excellent companion course for students taking the 3D Engine Programming modules and can be taken in parallel with those offerings. Since this course provides a fun and unique way to study mathematics, it would also be a great choice for students who wish to augment their studies in school. \n\nWhat are the prerequisites to understanding the course material? \n\nKnowledge of high school level algebra is required, so the Math Primer would be a great place to start if you are rusty. Experience with C++ programming would also be beneficial but is not required. \n\nWhat materials are necessary to complete the course? \n\nNo software is needed to complete this course.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a2c438bb6bcd29245119477d4f8a02bfa3362d","amp;dn":"Game+Mathematics+%2B+Solutions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a2c438bb6bcd29245119477d4f8a02bfa3362d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,162,196,56,187,107,205,41,36,81,25,71,125,79,138,2,191,163,54,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
