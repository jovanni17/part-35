There was NO AUDIO the first seven minutes of their program. This capture starts when the audio was finally restored on their feed.\n\nThe first story that was missed due to the audio being non-existent was about Denzel Washington partying on a yacht, and then the discovery of his subsequent month long supervised detox/cleanse afterwards.\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nSOURCE:\n\nWebRip\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nComments are appreciated.
