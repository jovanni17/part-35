The straighter work is oddly some of the most appealing here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and is a refreshing change to some of Zoller's more experimental (but still great) work from the period Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a great illustration of his strong tone on a simple line, in a way that we don't often get to hear on record. Straight numbers include &quot;Lady Love&quot; and &quot;Kaybee&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ juxtaposed with the more &quot;out&quot; &quot;Tshitar&quot;, and the soaring number &quot;Meet&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc0cc5d1d0f051e49500c23dee99bd371387a08","amp;dn":"Attila+Zoller+-+Common+Cause+%5B1979%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc0cc5d1d0f051e49500c23dee99bd371387a08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,192,204,93,29,15,5,30,73,80,12,35,222,233,155,211,113,56,122,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
