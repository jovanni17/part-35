This book helps solve both of these problems. The open source, no-cost penetration testing tools presented do a great job and can be modified by the user for each situation. Many tools, even ones that cost thousands of dollars, do not come with any type of instruction on how and in which situations the penetration tester can best use them. Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit, Third Edition, expands upon existing instructions so that a professional can get the most accurate and in-depth test results possible. Real-life scenarios are a major focus so that the reader knows which tool to use and how to use it for a variety of situations.\n\n\n    * Details current open source penetration testing tools\n\n    * Presents core technologies for each type of testing and the best tools for the job\n\n    * New to this edition: Enterprise application testing, client-side attacks and updates on Metasploit and Backtrack\n\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 464 pages\n    * Publisher: Syngress; 3 edition (August 1, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1597496278\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1597496278","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ebfb19d3b823119556ca5b909a527c8f4127ab6","amp;dn":"Penetration+Testers+Open+Source+Toolkit+3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ebfb19d3b823119556ca5b909a527c8f4127ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,191,177,157,59,130,49,25,85,108,165,185,9,165,39,200,244,18,122,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
