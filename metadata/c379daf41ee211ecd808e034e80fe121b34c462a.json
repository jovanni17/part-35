Well you may be as surprised as we were \nwhen we found their vessel being a puny wooden barge.\n\nWe infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security \nmeasures in place. We were able to run our own application, which turned out to \nbe a shell and began plundering some booty. Most shiny is probably a list of \nroughly 90,000 military emails and password hashes (md5, non-salted of course!).\nWe also added the complete sqldump, compressed ~50mb, for a good measure.\n\nWe also were able to access their svn, grabbing 4gb of source code. But this \nwas deemed insignificant and a waste of valuable space, so we merely grabbed \nit, and wiped it from their system.\n\nAdditionally we found some related datas on different servers we got access to \nafter finding credentials in the Booz Allen System. We added anything which \ncould be interesting.\n\nAnd last but not least we found maps and keys for various other treasure chests \nburied on the islands of government agencies, federal contractors and shady \nwhitehat companies. This material surely will keep our blackhat friends busy \nfor a while.\n\nA shoutout to all friendly vessels: Always remember, let it flow!\n#AntiSec\n\n/*******************************************************************************\n***                BONUS ROUND: BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON KEY FACTS                *** \n*******************************************************************************/\n\nFor the Lazy we have assembled some facts about Booz Allen. First let's take a \nquick look of who these guys are. Some key personnel:\n\n* John Michael &quot;Mike&quot; McConnell, Executive Vice President of Booz Allen and \nformer Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and former Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n\n* James R. Clapper, Jr., current Director of National Intelligence, former \nDirector of Defense Intelligence.\n\n* Robert James Woolsey Jr, former Director of National Intelligence and head\nof the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\n* Melissa Hathaway, Current Acting Senior Director for Cyberspace for the \nNational Security and Homeland Security Councils\n\nNow let's check out what these guys have been doing:\n\n* Questionable involvement in the U.S. government's SWIFT surveillance program; \nacting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily \ninvolved with those same agencies on other contracts. Beyond that, the \nimplication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program \n(electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the EC.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.aclu.org/national-security/booz-allens-extensive-ties-government&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.aclu.org/national-security/booz-allens-extensive-ties-government&lt;/a&gt;\n-raise-more-questions-about-swift-surveillanc\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.privacyinternational.org/article/pi-and-aclu-show-swift-auditor-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.privacyinternational.org/article/pi-and-aclu-show-swift-auditor-&lt;/a&gt;\nhas-extensive-ties-us-government\n \n* Through investigation of Booz Allen employees, Tim Shorrock of Democracy Now! \nasserts that there is a sort of revolving-door conflict of interest between \nBooz Allen and the U.S. government, and between multiple other contractors and \nthe U.S. government in general. Regarding Booz Allen, Shorrock referred to such \npeople as John M. McConnell, R. James Woolsey, Jr., and James R. Clapper, all \nof whom have gone back and forth between government and industry (Booz Allen in \nparticular), and who may present the appearance that certain government \ncontractors receive undue or unlawful business from the government, and that \ncertain government contractors may exert undue or unlawful influence on \ngovernment. Shorrock further relates that Booz Allen was a sub-contractor with \ntwo programs at the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), called Trailblazer and \nPioneer Groundbreaker.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/12/151224&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/12/151224&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you haven't heard about Pioneer Groundbreaker, we recommend the following \nWikipedia article:\n\n&quot;The NSA warrantless surveillance controversy (AKA &quot;Warrantless Wiretapping&quot;) \nconcerns surveillance of persons within the United States during the collection \nof foreign intelligence by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) as part of \nthe war on terror.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Groundbreaker&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Groundbreaker&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* A June 28, 2007 Washington Post article related how a U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more \nthan $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's \nlegal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. \nA Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized \nit as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be \ncompleted.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/&lt;/a&gt;\nAR2007062702988.html   \n \n* Known as PISCES (Personal Identification Secure Comparison and Evaluation \nSystem), the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œterrorist interdiction systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ matches passengers inbound for the \nUnited States against facial images, fingerprints and biographical information \nat airports in high-risk countries. A high-speed data network permits U.S. \nauthorities to be informed of problems with inbound passengers. Although PISCES \nwas operational in the months prior to September 11, it apparently failed to \ndetect any of the terrorists involved in the attack.\n\nPrivacy advocates have alleged that the PISCES system is deployed in various \ncountries that are known for human rights abuses (ie Pakistan and Iraq) and \nthat facilitating them with an advanced database system capable of storing \nbiometric details of travelers (often without consent of their own nationals) \nposes a danger to human rights activists and government opponents.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://multinationalmonitor.org/mm2002/02march/march02corp3.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://multinationalmonitor.org/mm2002/02march/march02corp3.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n/*******************************************************************************\n***                   BONUS ROUND TWO: ANONYMOUS INTERESTS                   *** \n*******************************************************************************/\n\nBack in February, as many may recall, Anonymous was challenged by security \ncompany HBGary. One month later - after many grandiose claims and several pages \nof dox on &quot;members&quot; of Anonymous which were factually accurate in no way \nwhatsoever - HBGary and its leadership were busy ruing the day they ever \ntangled with Anonymous, and Anonymous was busy toasting another epic trolling. \nAnd there was much rejoicing. However, celebration soon gave way to \nfascination, followed by horror, as scandal after scandal radiated from the \ncompany's internal files, scandals spanning the government, corporate and \nfinancial spheres. This was no mere trolling. Anonymous had uncovered a \nmonster.\n\nOne of the more interesting, and sadly overlooked, stories to emerge from \nHBGary's email server (a fine example to its customers of how NOT to secure \ntheir own email systems) was a military project - dubbed Operation Metal Gear \nby Anonymous for lack of an official title - designed to manipulate social \nmedia. The main aims of the project were two fold: Firstly, to allow a lone \noperator to control multiple false virtual identities, or &quot;sockpuppets&quot;. This \nwould allow them to infiltrate discussions groups, online polls, activist \nforums, etc and attempt to influence discussions or paint a false \nrepresentation of public opinion using the highly sophisticated sockpuppet \nsoftware. The second aspect of the project was to destroy the concept of online \nanonymity, essentially attempting to match various personas and accounts to a \nsingle person through recognition shared of writing styles, timing of online \nposts, and other factors. This, again, would be used presumably against any \nperceived online opponent or activist. \n\nHBGary Federal was just one of several companies involved in proposing software \nsolutions for this project. Another company involved was Booz Allen Hamilton. \nAnonymous has been investigating them for some time, and has uncovered all \nsorts of other shady practices by the company, including potentially illegal \nsurveillance systems, corruption between company and government officials, \nwarrantless wiretapping, and several other questionable surveillance projects. \nAll of this, of course, taking place behind closed doors, free from any public \nknowledge or scrutiny.\n\nYou would think the words &quot;Expect Us&quot; would have been enough to prevent another \nepic security fail, wouldn't you? \n\nWell, you'd be wrong. And thanks to the gross incompetence at Booz Allen \nHamilton probably all military mersonnel of the U.S. will now have to change \ntheir passwords. \n\nLet it flow!\n\n\n/*******************************************************************************\n***                                 INVOICE                                  *** \n*******************************************************************************/\n\nEnclosed is the invoice for our audit of your security systems, as well as the \nauditor's conclusion.\n\n4 hours of man power: $40.00\nNetwork auditing: $35.00\nWeb-app auditing: $35.00\nNetwork infiltration*: $0.00\nPassword and SQL dumping**: $200.00\nDecryption of data***: $0.00\nMedia and press****: $0.00\n\nTotal bill: $310.00\n\n*Price is based on the amount of effort required. \n**Price is based on the amount of badly secured data to be dumped, which in \nthis case was a substantial figure. \n***No security in place, no effort for intrusion needed. \n****Trolling is our specialty, we provide this service free of charge.\n\nAuditor's closing remarks: Pwned.
