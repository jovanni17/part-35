Since 2010 the shapeshifting producer has used that pseudonym to explore the ground between hip-hop, dubstep, jungle and house, with appearances on Civil Music, Metalheadz, Exit Records and his own Cosmic Bridge. (In that time he's also explored footwork as Philip D Kick.) Coming in at 15 tracks, Threads features guest appearances from Young Echo's MC Jabu, Jinadu, Gone The Hero and veteran London poet/musician Charlie Dark. It will be released on double-vinyl, CD and digital formats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0156ad3e703582157e4473198ba51e0ce480e32","amp;dn":"Om+Unit+-+Threads+2013+MP3%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0156ad3e703582157e4473198ba51e0ce480e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,21,106,211,231,3,88,33,87,228,71,49,152,186,81,224,206,72,14,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
