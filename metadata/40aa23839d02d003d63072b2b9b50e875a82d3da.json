The movie is based on the short story The Veldt by Ray Bradbury. It is a science fiction story about a Smart House that eventually turns against the parents.\n\n~Plot:~\n\nThe story begins with Ben Cooper and his family struggling to get a grip on household chores, school and work. Ben is the family caretaker, something he took up after his mother died. Always busy taking care of everyone else, he has no time to be a kid, including playing basketball, his favorite sport. When Ben sees that a Smart House is being given away, he enters the competition as often as he can. The family wins the house (named Pat), and is introduced to its creator, Sara Barnes.\n\nSoon after Nick Cooper and Sara begin to date, something Ben does not approve of, because he's worried his mom is being replaced. Ben begins to reprogram Pat, which is dangerous because of Pat's learning capabilities. He tries to get Pat to lighten up and act like stereotypical classic TV mom's.\n\nBen and his sister Angie have a party while Nick and Sara are on a date. Pat helps them cover up the party so they wouldn't get punished. But Nick finds a sweater of a girl who was at the party. As Pat's personality begins to radically change, the family starts to resent her. Eventually, Pat traps the family in the house, because she believes that the outside world is too dangerous. Sara tries to get back in to shut the house down and with Ben's help, she gets in through the newspaper chute, but becomes trapped with the rest. As they protest Pat's lockdown, she appears as a 1950's housewife hologram. Ben is able to end the lockdown by declaring that Pat isn't real and will never be a human. Pat finally unlocks the doors and windows, freeing them. Sara is then able to reboot Pat back to her original personality.\n\n~Cast~\n\n    * Ryan Merriman as Ben Cooper\n    * Katey Sagal as Pat, the Smart House\n    * Kevin Kilner as Nick Cooper\n    * Katie Volding as Angie Cooper\n    * Jessica Steen as Sara Barnes\n    * Paul Linke as Tuttle\n    * Raquel Beaudene as Gwen Patroni\n    * Joshua Boyd as Ryan\n    * Emilio Borelli as Miles\n    * Jason Lansing as Johnny\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40aa23839d02d003d63072b2b9b50e875a82d3da","amp;dn":"Smart+House+w%2F+Hebrew+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40aa23839d02d003d63072b2b9b50e875a82d3da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,170,35,131,157,2,208,3,214,48,114,178,185,181,14,135,90,130,211,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
