This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey says it was Dee Snyder of Twisted Sister who came to name Taylor Dane whose song &quot;Tell It To My Heart&quot; is at number 39.\n\nA listener wants to know what number one song has had the longest title. Casey says it was a long song title about a small bathing suit.\n\nCasey tells about groups of people changing their phone number from &quot;835-5937&quot; (Squeeze's hit at number 33) because of all the calls they started getting. Then he tells about a business that also has that number so couldn't change it but got creative instead. \n\n&quot;Stand By Me&quot; (by Ben E. King) previously held a record for most remakes into a single, having been remade six times (Casey plays a piece of each). Another song in this countdown just tied that record.\n\nThere is a song whose origins began when the writer was in kindergarten.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;When were there the most remakes in the top 40?&quot; Casey says in November of 1970 there were eight remakes in his countdown.\n\n40:    Live My Life (From The Film &quot;Hiding Out&quot;) - Boy George\n39:    Tell It To My Heart - Taylor Dayne\n38:    I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man - Prince            \n37:    The Way You Make Me Feel - Michael Jackson\n36:    Got My Mind Set On You - George Harrison\n35:    Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car - Billy Ocean\n34:    Twilight World - Swing Out Sister\n33:    835-5937 - Squeeze\n32:    Rocket 2 U - The Jets\n31:    (Sittin') On The Dock Of The Bay - Michael Bolton\n30:    Pop Goes The World - Men Without Hats\n29:    Because Of You - The Cover Girls\n28:    Hysteria - Def Leppard\n27:    The Man In The Mirror - Michael Jackson\n26:    I Want Her - Keith Sweat\nEXTRA: Wake Me Up Before You Go Go - Wham\n25:    Be Still My Beating Heart - Sting\n24:    Out Of The Blue - Debbie Gibson\n23:    I Live For Your Love - Natalie Cole\n22:    Love Overboard - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n21:    Tunnel Of Love - Bruce Springsteen\n20:    Endless Summer Nights - Richard Marx\n19:    Push It - Salt-N-Pepa\n18:    Just Like Paradise - David Lee Roth\n17:    Everywhere - Fleetwood Mac\n16:    I Found Someone - Cher\n15:    Hazy Shade Of Winter - Bangles\n14:    Need You Tonight Ã¢â‚¬â€œ INXS\n13:    Pump Up The Volume - M/A/R/R/S\n12:    I Get Weak - Belinda Carlisle\n11:    Can't Stay Away From You - Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine\n10:    I Don't Want To Be Your Man - Roger\n9:    Don't Shed A Tear - Paul Carrack\n8:    Never Gonna Give You Up - Rick Astley\n7:    She's Like The Wind - Patrick Swayze (Featuring Wendy Fraser)\nLDD: YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re The Inspiration - Chicago\n6:    Say You Will - Foreigner\n5:    Hungry Eyes (From &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;) - Eric Carmen\n4:    Father Figure - George Michael\n3:    Could've Been - Tiffany\n2:    What Have I Done To Deserve This? - Pet Shop Boys &amp; Dusty Springfield\n1:    Seasons Change - Expose ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce64c3f129b75065e6ea2d9019dd9969ee99dcf","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1988_February_20th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce64c3f129b75065e6ea2d9019dd9969ee99dcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,230,76,63,18,155,117,6,94,110,162,217,1,157,217,150,158,233,157,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
