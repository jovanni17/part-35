This Web companion to the four-part series takes a close look at the primal instinct that causes animals to come together in order to pass along their genes to the next generation. We also examine how timing can be key in the mating process, and how varied sex contracts create not only new life, but diversity, in both animals and humans.\n\n\n1)  The Primal Instinct \n&quot;All nature's creatures,&quot; the British novelist Graham Swift once wrote, &quot;join to express nature's purpose.&quot; And that purpose is illustrated in delightful and sometimes dizzying detail in NATURE's THE NATURE OF SEX. As Part 1: THE PRIMAL INSTINCT shows, birds, bees, and even barnacles and naked mole rats are driven to join forces to reproduce and pass along their genes to the next generation.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img19/2526/natureofsexscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img19/2526/natureofsexscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: Xvid\n * Video Bitrate: 1660kb/s\n * Video Resolution: 640x480\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 4:3\n * Audio Codec: MP3\n * Audio BitRate: 128kb/s\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * RunTime Per Part: 55min\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 700MB\n * Ripped by JumpinS\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Official Website\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:142d2b38f2daeee2f090d928bfc28d5810855a69","amp;dn":"PBS+The+Nature+of+Sex+1of6+The+Primal+Instinct+Xvid-MP3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"142d2b38f2daeee2f090d928bfc28d5810855a69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,45,43,56,242,218,238,226,240,144,217,40,191,194,141,88,16,133,90,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
