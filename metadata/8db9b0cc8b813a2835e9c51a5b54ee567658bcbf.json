A quest for a thorough analysis, interpretation, modeling and prediction of time series comes with an ongoing challenge for developing models that are both accurate and user-friendly (interpretable).\n\nThe volume is aimed to exploit the conceptual and algorithmic framework of Computational Intelligence (CI) to form a cohesive and comprehensive environment for building models of time series. The contributions covered in the volume are fully reflective of the wealth of the CI technologies by bringing together ideas, algorithms, and numeric studies, which convincingly demonstrate their relevance, maturity and visible usefulness. It reflects upon the truly remarkable diversity of methodological and algorithmic approaches and case studies.\n\nThis volume is aimed at a broad audience of researchers and practitioners engaged in various branches of operations research, management, social sciences, engineering, and economics. Owing to the nature of the material being covered and a way it has been arranged, it establishes a comprehensive and timely picture of the ongoing pursuits in the area and fosters further developments.\n\nContent Level Ã‚Â» Research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8db9b0cc8b813a2835e9c51a5b54ee567658bcbf","amp;dn":"Time+Series+Analysis%2C+Modeling+and+Applications%3A+A+Computational","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8db9b0cc8b813a2835e9c51a5b54ee567658bcbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,185,176,204,139,129,58,40,53,233,197,26,91,84,238,86,118,88,188,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
