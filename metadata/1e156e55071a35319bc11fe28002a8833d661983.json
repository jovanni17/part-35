It featured five pastel-colored talking dogs that came through an interdimensional doorway and into the lives of ten year old boy, Jamie, with his slightly older neighbor, Claire. The dogs were the intended prey of the evil miser Wagstaff. Disney&amp;#039;s Fluppy Dogs aired on the Disney Channel, which, had the term have been in use then, would have made it the first-ever animated Disney Channel Original Movie, beating out Kim Possible: So the Drama by 19 years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e156e55071a35319bc11fe28002a8833d661983","amp;dn":"Disney+Cartoon+-+Fluppy+Dogs+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e156e55071a35319bc11fe28002a8833d661983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,21,110,85,7,26,53,49,155,193,31,226,128,2,168,131,61,102,25,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
