And, as Al Capone before him, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon complains of the thankless task of being a &quot;public benefactor&quot;. \n\nIn the second half of the show, Max talks to Reggie Middleton about German debt and MF Global.        \n\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
