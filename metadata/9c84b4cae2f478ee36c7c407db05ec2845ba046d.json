It gives the background, insights, and specific procedures needed by all beginning writers. Here one can learn how to group words into copy that moves, movement into scenes, and scenes into stories; how to develop characters, how to revise and polish, and finally, how to sell the product.\r\n\r\nNo one can teach talent, but the practical skills of the professional writer's craft can certainly be taught. The correct and imaginative use of these skills can shorten any beginner's apprenticeship by years.\r\n\r\nThis is the book for writers who want to turn rejection slips into cashable checks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c84b4cae2f478ee36c7c407db05ec2845ba046d","amp;dn":"Techniques+of+the+Selling+Writer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c84b4cae2f478ee36c7c407db05ec2845ba046d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,132,180,202,226,244,120,238,54,199,196,7,219,5,236,40,69,186,4,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
