It is a large file size, but it played just fine with Roxio 8 Cineplayer with the Divx.com codec on Vixta.  I also was able to burn it with PowerISO directly from file and watch the entire hour and fifty minutes with my generic Magnavox Divx stand alone.  The quality is VHS - Divx 48 Khz sound.\n\nFile Size:  2.69 GB\nLength:     1:50\nFile:       Divx 6.8\n\nJerryTJr.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f526b280f98ecc972d34589769e12f8a6395761c","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Woodstock+99.divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f526b280f98ecc972d34589769e12f8a6395761c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,38,178,128,249,142,204,151,45,52,88,151,105,225,47,138,99,149,118,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
