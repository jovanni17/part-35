It was released in 1985. Considered a breakthrough album for the band, it featured their first top 5 single in the United States, &quot;What You Need.&quot; This album also marks their alliance with Chris Thomas, who would produce the band's most successful albums.\n\nThe band had perfected a matured sound influenced by Led Zeppelin and XTC, but true to the band's original roots in the Aussie pubs. Listen Like Thieves was highly approved of by critics. In the US this first single, &quot;This Time&quot;, stalled at #81 in late 1985, but the band roared out of nowhere with the second, &quot;What You Need&quot;, which in early 1986 became a Top-Five Billboard hit, bringing INXS their first breakout U.S. success. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listen_Like_Thieves&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listen_Like_Thieves&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aacDDAadb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aacDDAadb&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 768x576 25.00fps 8780kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:07\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
