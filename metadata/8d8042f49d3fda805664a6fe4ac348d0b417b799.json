The record features several legendary musicians, including Little Richard and Bob Dylan, as well as Cash's daughter Rosanne. It concentrates primarily on Cash's biggest hits, such as &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, &quot;Hey Porter&quot; and &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;, although &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, one of Cash's most well-known songs, was not covered.\n\nMarty Stuart's belief, and proclamation, has resulted in an impressive, yet eclectic, mix of artists who came together for Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash, which was released Sept. 24 by Columbia/Lucky Dog Records. Stuart produced the record.\n\nKindred Spirits is the second Cash tribute project in as many weeks. An independent label, Dualtone Records, released Dressed In Black: A Tribute to Johnny Cash on Sept. 17.\n\nWhen Stuart was approached two years ago about doing a Cash tribute record, he spent some time deciding on the right approach.\n\n&quot;A tribute to Johnny Cash is not the most original concept in the world,&quot; Stuart said recently from Nashville's Columbia Records office. &quot;But he's never been heralded as a great American songwriter that has affected a whole lot of different genres of people.&quot;\n\nSo Stuart paired classic Cash compositions with some of music's finest. The end project features Bob Dylan, Little Richard, Keb' Mo', Bruce Springsteen, Dwight Yoakum, Hank Williams Jr., Roseanne Cash, Sheryl Crow, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Emmylou Harris and others.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d8042f49d3fda805664a6fe4ac348d0b417b799","amp;dn":"Emmylou+Harris%2C+Carpenter+%26+Crow-Flesh+And+Blood+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d8042f49d3fda805664a6fe4ac348d0b417b799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,128,66,244,157,63,218,128,86,100,166,254,74,195,72,208,180,23,183,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
