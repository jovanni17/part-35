Starting in the early 1980s the top one percent (1%) broke away from the rest of us to become the most unstable force in the economy. An elite that had once been the flat line on the American income charts - models of financial propriety - suddenly set off on a wild ride of economic binges.\n\nNot only do they control more than a third of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealth, their increasing vulnerability to the booms and busts of the stock market wreak havoc on our consumer economy, financial markets, communities, employment opportunities, and government finances.\n\nRobert FrankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insightful analysis provides the disturbing big picture of high-beta wealth. His vivid storytelling brings you inside the mortgaged mansions, blown-up balance sheets, repossessed Bentleys and Gulfstreams, and wrecked lives and relationships:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How one couple frittered away a fortune trying to build AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest house Ã¢â‚¬â€90,000 square feet with 23 full bathrooms, a 6,000 square foot master suite with a bed on a rotating platformÃ¢â‚¬â€only to be forced to put it on the market because Ã¢â‚¬Å“we really need the moneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Repo men who are now the scavengers of the wealthy, picking up private jets, helicopters, yachts and racehorses Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the shiny remains of a decade of conspicuous consumption financed with debt, asset bubbles, Ã¢â‚¬Å“liquidity events,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and soaring stock prices.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How Ã¢â‚¬Å“big money ruins everythingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for communities such as Aspen, Colorado whose over-reliance on the rich created a stratified social scene of velvet ropes and A-lists and crises in employment opportunities, housing, and tax revenues.
