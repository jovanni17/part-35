Cuddy's amazing booklet President Clinton Will Continue the New World Order (1993) which explains why Bill Clinton and democrats in general are also part and parcel of New World Order movement that was usually asssociated with George Bush and the republicans. When Bill Clinton and democrats took over the US government many felt that the concept of New World Order was discarded.   As clearly shown by dr. Cuddy's research, this is a false assumption and if one looks at Clinton's background, the reasons become obvious. First, he was a Rhodes scholar, and Cecil Rhodes had his own plan for world domination. Thus, it seems unlikely that his scholars would be individuals who were not &quot;one-worlders.&quot; Second, Clinton has been with the three leading &quot;one-world&quot; organizations, which are the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Trilateral Commission (TC), and the Bilderbergers. In addition, during the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton said that when he was at Georgetown University, he was greatly influenced by Prof. Carroll Quigley who wrote Tragedy and Hope, in which Quigley said he had &quot;no aversion&quot; to most of the plans of the network of one-worlders whose secret records he had been privy to. Also includes a short chronology of the internationalists movement. Find out how it really doesn't matter which one of the mainstream political parties take the seat in the White House as the overall plan remains completely fixed. 50 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ee26be4d68e76ada3d94f7ba4174d256110ea0e","amp;dn":"Cuddy-Clinton+Will+Continue+New+World+Order%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ee26be4d68e76ada3d94f7ba4174d256110ea0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,226,107,228,214,142,118,173,163,217,79,123,164,23,77,37,97,16,234,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
