It's a satire of American History, from Columbus through the Revolutionary War.\n\nThis is a re-release from the 90's. It includes a few extra seconds within a couple scenes compared to the original release, plus a couple whole scenes added.\n\nMP3 sampled at 256Kbps from CD by iTunes.\n\nThis is a re-seed of my earlier post, which seems to have died.
