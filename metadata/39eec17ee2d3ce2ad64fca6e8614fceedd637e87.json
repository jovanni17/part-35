As the USCCA continues to expand its reach across the US and since its flagship publication Concealed Carry Magazine has become one of, if not THE most informative gun magazine in the nation, reaching up to the next level of media outlets became a natural, no brainer. \n\n\nStop by \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.takinglibertees.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.takinglibertees.com/&lt;/a&gt;  Get a shirt to show your support for the 2nd Amendment of our Bill Of Rights\n \nThanks to The United States Concealed Carry Association for getting to word out!! \n\nGo here for Matthew Bracken's books (epub, pdf, txt) that have been on the money so far!\n  \n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9044113/Matthew_Bracken_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9044113/Matthew_Bracken_&lt;/a&gt;   \n2003 Enemies Foreign And Domestic \n2006 Domestic Enemies_ The Reconquista \n2009 Foreign Enemies And Traitors\n\n\n\nBen Stein\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://spectator.org/departments/ben-steins-diary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://spectator.org/departments/ben-steins-diary&lt;/a&gt;\n \n&quot;...there is something going on out there, and its frightening...&quot;\n\n\nAnarchy U.S.A.

Although it was produced in 1965 at the height of the civil-rights movement, it is far from being out of date. It provides lessons and insights that could not have been appreciated almost five decades ago.\n\nThis is not about blacks vs. whites, instead of merely telling the story of the 1960s riots, this is about what preceded those riots, who wanted them to happen, how they were organized, and what they were intended to accomplish. The focus is not merely on racial issues but on how any difference between groups of citizens can be used to manipulate them into acts of self-destruction.\n\nMany thanks to Liberty In Our Time for the upload!\n\n480x360p in mp4\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39eec17ee2d3ce2ad64fca6e8614fceedd637e87","amp;dn":"Armed+American+Radio+November+03+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39eec17ee2d3ce2ad64fca6e8614fceedd637e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,238,193,126,226,211,206,42,214,79,202,110,134,20,252,238,221,99,126,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
