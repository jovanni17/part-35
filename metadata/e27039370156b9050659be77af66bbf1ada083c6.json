Up on the roof, Challenge One is to patch a hole, complete with shingles and a waterproof membrane. Challenge Two has the participants channeling their inner child as they design and build a teeter-totter. Tension mounts as this balance of power pits weaker team members against their so called better halves. But things lighten up in Challenge Three, when our fearless couples herd a brood of chickens into their newly constructed coops. This soon becomes a clustercluck of epic proportions.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 04-May-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27039370156b9050659be77af66bbf1ada083c6","amp;dn":"Blood.Sweat.and.Tools.S01E04.PDTV.x264-CBM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27039370156b9050659be77af66bbf1ada083c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,112,57,55,1,86,185,5,6,89,190,119,175,102,187,241,173,160,131,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
