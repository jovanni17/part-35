Whereas &quot;Nimrod&quot; set a theme for each show, thus creating a context, Fist Of Fun&amp;#039;s only context stipulation was that the material should fit into the format of a &quot;Lifestyle show presented by two blokes in their mid 20&amp;#039;s who live in separate, but equally unpleasant, rented accommodation in South London&amp;#039;&quot;.\nThat meant that pretty much anything was allowed to be included, giving Rich &amp; Stew more freedom in their material, and the incessant talk of daytime TV and other mundanities coming from two people who were clearly very intelligent struck a chord with the nation&amp;#039;s listeners.\nMaintaining a stay of only one series on radio one, as the station moved away from the half hour comedy show format. Fist Of Fun returned on BBC2 television in early 1995.\nBroadcast over six weeks, going out at 9pm on Thursday nights throughout April &amp; May, it was an immediate success, although not an instant rating winner, and Lee &amp; Herring enjoyed a brief tenure as media darlings while they were hailed as the next big thing. \nFile Name: FoF Series 2 Episode 1.wmv\nFile Size: 104 MB (109,439,790 bytes)\nRuntime: 29 mins 23 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  501kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 15/02/1996\t\n\nFile Name: FoF Series 2 Episode 2.wmv\nFile Size: 97.4 MB (102,211,669 bytes)\nRuntime: 27 mins 27 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  501kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 22/02/1996\t\n\nFile Name: FoF Series 2 Episode 3.wmv\nFile Size: 110 MB (116,089,669 bytes)\nRuntime: 31 mins 11 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  501kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 01/03/1996\t\n\nFile Name: FoF Series 2 Episode 4.wmv\nFile Size: 103 MB (108,615,478 bytes)\nRuntime: 29 mins 10 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  501kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 08/03/1996\n\t\nFile Name: FoF Series 2 Episode 5.wmv\nFile Size: 104 MB (109,605,885 bytes)\nRuntime: 29 mins 26 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  501kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 15/03/1996\n\nFile Name: FoF Series 2 Episode 6.wmv\nFile Size: 104 MB (109,624,338 bytes)\nRuntime: 29 mins 26 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  501kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 22/03/1996\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ba145e07766d28f5b126bb5943d02ec6a314cec","amp;dn":"FIST+OF+FUN+SERIES+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ba145e07766d28f5b126bb5943d02ec6a314cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,161,69,224,119,102,210,143,91,18,107,181,148,61,2,236,106,49,76,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
