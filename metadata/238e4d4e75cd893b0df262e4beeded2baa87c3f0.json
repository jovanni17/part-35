When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua commands and provides simple built-in tools for creating your own cartridges.\n\nSpecs\nDisplay \t\t128x128 16 colours\nCartridge Size \t\t32k\nSound \t\t4 channel chip blerps\nCode \t\tLua\nSprites \t\t128 8x8 sprites\nMap \t\t128x32 cels\nControls \t\t2 6-button joysticks\n\nThe harsh limitations of PICO-8 are carefully chosen to be fun to work with, encourage small but expressive designs and hopefully to give PICO-8 cartridges their own particular look and feel.\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\nCreative Tools\n\nPICO-8 has tools for editing code, music, sound, sprites, maps built right into the console. Create a whole game or program in one sitting without needing to leave the cosy development environment!\n\n\t\t\nShareable Cartridges\n\nPICO-8 cartidges can be saved in a special .png format and sent directly to other users or played via an online cart player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:238e4d4e75cd893b0df262e4beeded2baa87c3f0","amp;dn":"%5BMulti%5DPico-8+Fantasy+Microconsole+Alpha+0.1.1+ZippyRealease","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"238e4d4e75cd893b0df262e4beeded2baa87c3f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,142,77,78,117,205,137,59,13,242,98,228,190,237,237,43,170,135,195,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
