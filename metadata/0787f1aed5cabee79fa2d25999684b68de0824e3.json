Pardalos, Mario V. F. Pereira, Niko A. Iliadis, &quot;Handbook of Power Systems II (Energy Systems)&quot;\nPublisher: Springer | 2010 | ISBN 3642126855 | PDF | 500 pages\n\nEnergy is one of the world`s most challenging problems, and power systems are an important aspect of energy related issues. This handbook contains state-of-the-art contributions on power systems modeling and optimization. The book is separated into two volumes with six sections, which cover the most important areas of energy systems. The first volume covers the topics operations planning and expansion planning while the second volume focuses on transmission and distribution modeling, forecasting in energy, energy auctions and markets, as well as risk management. The contributions are authored by recognized specialists in their fields and consist in either state-of-the-art reviews or examinations of state-of-the-art developments. The articles are not purely theoretical, but instead also discuss specific applications in power systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0787f1aed5cabee79fa2d25999684b68de0824e3","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Power+Systems+II+%282010%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0787f1aed5cabee79fa2d25999684b68de0824e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,135,241,174,213,202,190,231,159,162,210,89,153,104,75,104,222,8,36,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
