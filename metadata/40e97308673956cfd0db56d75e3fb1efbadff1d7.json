This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nAll three extras are hosted by Casey Kasem and come from the original show.\n\nErnie, the Muppet from Sesame Street, debuts at number 36 with his novelty hit, &quot;Rubber Duckie.&quot;\n\nThis is the last week in the Top 40 for &quot;Mama Told Me&quot; by Three Dog Night. It was the number one song on the very first AT40 ever broadcast just 9 weeks earlier, now it is at number 27.\n\nElvis Presley is at number 32 with his single, &quot;I've Lost You.&quot; Casey informs listeners that Elvis once kissed Casey's date at one of his shows. Casey didn't take it lying down, though. He reports he started dating someone else!\n\n&quot;I Who Have Nothing&quot; is a former hit by Ben E. King. This week, Tom Jones (who DOES have something) debuts his version at number 29. &quot;Don't Play That Song&quot; was also a hit for King. This week Aretha Franklin and The Dixie Flyers have it at number 21 and they ARE going to play it.\n\nNeil Diamond claims two spots in the Top 40, number 40 with, &quot;Cracklin' Rosie&quot; and number 24 with, &quot;Solitary Man.&quot;\n\nCasey says James Brown formerly shined shoes in front of the Georgia radio station he now owns. His hit, &quot;Get On Up (Sex Machine)&quot; is in the number 22 spot.\n\nFinally, the number one song in each week's AT40 broadcast was almost always preceded by a drum roll, but this week, the session singers who continually announce other chart positions also sing the solitary symbol.\n\n40:  Cracklin' Rosie - Neil Diamond\n39:  Big Yellow Taxi - The Neighborhood\n38:  It's A Shame - The Spinners\n37:  The Sly, The Slick And The Wicked - The Lost Generation\n36:  Rubber Duckie - Ernie\n35:  Summertime Blues - The Who\n34:  I Want To Take You Higher - Ike &amp; Tina Turner\n33:  Candida - Dawn\n32:  I've Lost You - Elvis Presley\n31:  I'm Losing You - Rare Earth\n30:  Ball Of Confusion - Temptations\n29:  I Who Have Nothing - Tom Jones\n28:  Ooh Child - The Five Stairsteps\n27:  Mama Told Me - Three Dog Night\nEXTRA: Tammy - Debbie Reynolds (1957)\n26:  Snowbird - Anne Murray\n25:  Groovy Situation - Gene Chandler\n24:  Solitary Man - Neil Diamond\n23:  Everybody's Got The Right To Love - Supremes\n22:  Get On Up (Sex Machine) - James Brown\n21:  Don't Play That Song - Aretha Franklin with The Dixie Flyers\n20:  Julie Do You Love Me - Bobby Sherman\nEXTRA: Heart Breaker - Gene Pitney (1968)\n19:  Hand Me Down World - Guess Who\n18:  Lay A Little Lovin' On Me - Robin McNamara\n17:  Tell It All Brother - Kenny Rogers &amp; the First Edition\n16:  Overture From Tommy - The Assembled Multitude\nOLDIE: Chances Are - Johnny Mathis (1957)\n15:  Tighter Tighter - Alive and Kicking\n14:  Heidi-Ho - Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears\nEXTRA: You Are My Sunshine - Ray Charles (1962)\n13:  Band Of Gold - Freda Payne\n12:  Lookin' Out My Back Door - Creedence Clearwater Revival\n11:  I Just Can't Help Believing - B.J.
