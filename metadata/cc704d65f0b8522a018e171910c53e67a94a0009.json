It was released on 15 September 2003 in Japan, on 22 September 2003 in the United Kingdom on Mushroom Records and A&amp;E Records and on 23 March 2004 in the United States by East West Records and Taste Media. The album followed up on its predecessor's diverse musical tendencies and elaborate sound, while also having a more focused and consistent theme and aesthetic throughout. Absolution has a noticeably darker and heavier tone musically, with a lyrical focus on the theological and apocalyptic concepts.\n\nThe album reached number one in the UK Album Charts. It also yielded the bands first top 10 single hit, with &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot; peaking at number 8 in the UK singles chart. In 2009, it was voted by Kerrang! as the second-best album of the 21st century thus far. (Muse's previous album, Origin of Symmetry, and their subsequent release, Black Holes and Revelations, also appeared in the top fifty).\n\nTrack listing:\n\nAll lyrics written by Matthew Bellamy, all music composed by Muse.\n\n1. \t&quot;Intro&quot;                             0:22\n2. \t&quot;Apocalypse Please&quot;                 4:12\n3. \t&quot;Time Is Running Out&quot;               3:56\n4. \t&quot;Sing for Absolution&quot;               4:54\n5. \t&quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;                4:58\n6. \t&quot;Falling Away with You&quot;             4:40\n7. \t&quot;Interlude&quot;                         0:37\n8. \t&quot;Hysteria&quot;                          3:47\n9. \t&quot;Blackout&quot;                          4:22\n10. \t&quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot;        5:01\n11. \t&quot;The Small Print&quot;                   3:28\n12. \t&quot;Endlessly&quot;                         3:49\n13. \t&quot;Thoughts of a Dying Atheist&quot;       3:11\n14. \t&quot;Ruled by Secrecy&quot;                  4:54\n\nPersonnel\n\nMatthew Bellamy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, lead and rhythm guitars, keyboards, programming, string arrangements, production\nChristopher Wolstenholme  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals, production\nDominic Howard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, programming, percussion, production\n\n\nSupport the artists you love.
