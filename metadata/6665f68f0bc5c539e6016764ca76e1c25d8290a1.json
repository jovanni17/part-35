Although written over 20 years ago the ideas inside are still very much valid today as many billions are poured into useless missile defense systems while a much cheaper beam defense would be much more effective. Today USA could easily build a short wavelength space-based laser system that could defend the nation against a full-scale ballistic missile attack. Find out how such a system works and why it is endlessly better from any missile based defense. 175 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6665f68f0bc5c539e6016764ca76e1c25d8290a1","amp;dn":"Bardwell-Beam+Defense-Alternative+to+Nuclear+Destruction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6665f68f0bc5c539e6016764ca76e1c25d8290a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,101,246,143,11,197,197,57,230,1,103,100,202,118,225,194,93,130,144,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
