The bin and cue files were generated by PowerISO 4.4.\n\nThe files were ripped from the original cd to wav files then Adobe Audition was used to create the 6 channels. Finally, SurCode was used to encode to DTS surround sound.\n\nI checked this out on my surround system and all 6 speakers are active.\n\nPlease leave a comment after you listen to this and let me know what you think. This is my first cd conversion to 5.1 DTS surround cd. I solicit constructive criticism, but please don't flame. \n\n\nThis sounds great crancked up on my surround stereo so I thought I would share this with this community. \n\nEnjoy.\n\nNote: You must have a surround sound system with DTS decoder to play this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c40802a8ca4594a96425252acaf52bb527596a","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+-+Off+The+Ground+5.1+DTS+Upmix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92c40802a8ca4594a96425252acaf52bb527596a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,196,8,2,168,202,69,148,169,100,37,37,42,202,245,43,181,39,89,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
