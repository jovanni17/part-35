The importer or customs broker should state on the form why permission is required before submitting it to the local CBSA office.\n\nEach shipment must be supplied with a commercial invoice or Canada Customs invoice. If the goods are dutiable a NAFTA Certificate of Origin is needed for duty\nexemption for commercial shipments. It is the responsibility of the exporter (vendor) to issue and supply these documents.\n\nNote for Canadian importers:\nPlease direct your US vendors to this page where they can download the forms.\nIf they have any questions regarding the documents, they are welcome to contact us directly.\n\nThis PDF can also be downloaded from http://argocustoms.com/Forms-CanadaCustoms-NAFTA-Certificate-Statement-LVS-Exporter.php\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1537e654e7f1a3aea08a106c6a0baacff2aa6185","amp;dn":"PERMISSION+FOR+SPECIAL+PURPOSES+C6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1537e654e7f1a3aea08a106c6a0baacff2aa6185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,55,230,84,231,241,163,174,160,138,16,108,106,11,170,207,242,170,97,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
