They always gather the full concert halls. The authors of the famous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ albums. \nNino Katamadze launched her new album, entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It follows her two releases of 2006, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ LPs, both of which enjoyed great critical acclaim. Immediately after their release, they turned into a kind of alternative currency.\nIn a similar spirit, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlack,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhite,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as a joint concept have been termed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa line of colorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by the singer - a symbol of multifaceted unity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthat gives a certain dynamism and energy to the discs.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½&quot;\n\nHere are three albums of Nino Katamadze: Black, White, Blue. \nFirst album &quot;Black&quot; is rhythmic instrumental jazz-blues disk.\nSecond album &quot;White&quot; contain several tracks from first disk, but in quite electronic versions and new things.\nLast album &quot;Blue&quot; is something between these ones, album of melodic jazz music, I think...\nIf you want to download only one album for start, try &quot;black&quot;. Last composition from this disk is great!\nSorry, I have not box from disk &quot;Black&quot;, so covers are not original, but they are not very different ;) I made them myself from &quot;White&quot; album.\n\nAll tracks are separate &amp; with tags. Ripped by EAC. All pictures in booklet is 300 pixels/inch.\nIf you want to burn this CD, you can download cole2K nero audio plug-in (google helps you), or use alcohol, EAC  etc. \nI can't seed all the time, but I'll seed every night, till someone downloads. Just wait. I'll be happy if you seed few days after download.\nIf you think you want something else, just tell me here.\n\nP.S. Sorry for my bad English. I'm Russian.\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4cd343d15c4fa2cbe42ab33aaefcfcac635789f","amp;dn":"Nino+Katamadze+%26+Insight+-+Black%2C+White%2C+Blue+%5BFLAC%5D+%2B+covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4cd343d15c4fa2cbe42ab33aaefcfcac635789f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,205,52,61,21,196,250,44,190,66,171,51,170,239,207,202,198,53,120,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
