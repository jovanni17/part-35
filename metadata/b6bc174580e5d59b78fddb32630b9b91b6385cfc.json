I don't know about you, but a musician's views on world situations leave me empty and sound rather dated after a while. Which is why I like this CD so much. The tunes on this disc all tell a story of their own, taking the listener on many different journeys, and away from the problems of our worldly situations. And these songs will sound fresh a hundred years from now. \nMy particular favorite is Ballad of Robin Winter-Smith for no other reason than I love Nanci's vocals in it. Also, Spin On A Red Brick Floor is another wonderful tune on which Ms. Griffith sings of a favorite club of her's located in (I believe) Texas. By the way, she sings the whole first verse without taking a breath! \nI'm not Driving These Wheels could have been an FM rocker, with its driving beat. And the title tune is just beautiful. \nNotice I didn't write much on her lyrics. The stories Nanci tells in these earlier recordings warrant the listener to come up with their own &quot;pictures&quot; as they listen. Nanci's voice, in her prime here, suits the music and words perfectly. \nOnce In A Very Blue Moon and the follow up Last Of The True Believers are two of the best folk rock / storytelling CD's out there. \nNanci at her finest. \n \ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6bc174580e5d59b78fddb32630b9b91b6385cfc","amp;dn":"Nanci+Griffith...Once+in+a+Very+Blue+Moon%281984%29remastered%282002%29%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6bc174580e5d59b78fddb32630b9b91b6385cfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,188,23,69,128,229,213,155,120,253,219,50,99,11,155,145,182,56,92,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
