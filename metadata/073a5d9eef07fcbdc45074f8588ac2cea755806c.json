An examination of these works offers some stimulating insights into the aesthetics of Nazism, particularly as to how the emphasis on classicism related to ideas about racial purity.\n\nThese banal little watercolors also offer a look at Hitler's own personal tastes, reflected in his obsession for paintings that were almost exact reproductions from life, with very little room for imagination or interpretation. With the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II coming up in 2005, this is sure to be a timely and important book.\n\n56 pages in total, PDF, English\n\nPlease SEED\nLong Live Pirate Bay!\n\n\nPeace to all \t\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:073a5d9eef07fcbdc45074f8588ac2cea755806c","amp;dn":"The+Water+Colours+of+Hitler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"073a5d9eef07fcbdc45074f8588ac2cea755806c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,58,93,158,239,7,252,189,196,80,116,248,88,138,194,206,167,85,128,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
