Their four frames view organizations as factories, families, jungles, and theaters or temples:\n\nThe Structural Frame: how to organize and structure groups and teams to get results.\nThe Human Resource Frame: how to tailor organizations to satisfy human needs, improve human resource management, and build positive interpersonal and group dynamics.\nThe Political Frame: how to cope with power and conflict, build coalitions, hone political skills, and deal with internal and external politics.\nThe Symbolic Frame: how to shape a culture that gives purpose and meaning to work, stage organizational drama for internal and external audiences, and build team spirit through ritual, ceremony, and story.\n\nThe core of the book is reframing, a tool for finding new opportunities and options in confusing and troubling organizational situations. The authors show how multiple frames give leaders an edge in decoding organizational complexity. The new edition highlights current developments in organizational and leadership research. It presents new case examples from organizations such as eBay, Enron, Harley-Davidson, the New York City Fire Department, and the U.S. Marine Corps. The book also introduces &quot;Organizational TheoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Greatest Hits,&quot; text boxes that ground the book in the most influential scholarly work. The new edition also offers a rich mix of geographic, cultural, and gender diversity throughout.
