Drums, keyboard, guitar, sampler, himself on bass, a singer, a saxophonist and a three piece string section. It took time to pull it together but the results have been spectacular. \n\nFrom playing the Luminaire, the group are now selling out venues like Koko and Forum in Kentish Town. And the musical freedom that Green has found has fed back into his studio music, so that the new record he is currently completing promises to be his best yet. This live DVD is interspersed with interview footage with Bonobo. \n\nDespite his unassuming demeanour, Green takes his music very seriously. With 9 million listed plays on Last FM and sell out shows, a lot of other people are, too.\t\n\n\nLabel:\t         Ninja Tune\nCatalog#:\t ZENDV119\nFormat:\t         DVD\nCountry:    \t UK\nReleased:\t 2009\nGenre:\t         Electronic, Funk / Soul\nStyle:\t         Future Jazz, Downtempo, Soul\nCredits:\t Bass, Voice [Interview] - Simon Green \n                 Cello - Wayne Urquhart \n                 Directed By - Steven Glashier \n                 Drums - Jack Baker \n                 Guitar - Ewan Wallace \n                 Keyboards, Other [Electronics] - Simon Little \n                 Mixed By, Engineer - Stephen Hodge \n                 Percussion, Other [Electronics] - Andy Wilkins \n                 Producer - Russell Porter \n                 Saxophone - Ben Cooke  \n                 Violin - Jote Oshan* \n                 Violin, Arranged By [Strings] - Mike Simmonds \n                 Vocals - Kathrin Deboer*\nNotes:\t         Live concert with interviews.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1\t \tDays To Come\n2\t \tNothing Owed\n3\t \tKetto\n4\t \tDismantling Frank\n5\t \tWalking In The Sky\n6\t \tNoctuary\n7\t \tThe Plug\n8\t \tFlutter\n9\t \tNightlite\n10\t \tTransmission 94\n11\t \tBetween The Lines\n12\t \tOn Your Marks\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8180d7d1569c10e58ef8f7423680a01bc6042f5","amp;dn":"Bonobo+-+Live+At+Koko","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8180d7d1569c10e58ef8f7423680a01bc6042f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,24,13,125,21,105,193,14,88,239,143,116,35,104,10,1,188,96,66,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
