His compositions, of which around 500 are commonly known, are noted for their contemplative nature and for capturing the essence of the raga forms through the vainika (veena) style that emphasises gamakas. They are typically in a slower speed (chowka kala). He is also known by his signature name of Guruguha.[1] His compositions are widely sung and played in classical concerts of Carnatic music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a57ae0a6d77f12d4ebb340a25a8b0c95b7667254","amp;dn":"Muthuswami+Dikshitar+Kritis+Various+Artists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a57ae0a6d77f12d4ebb340a25a8b0c95b7667254","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,122,224,166,215,127,18,212,235,179,64,162,90,139,12,149,183,102,114,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
