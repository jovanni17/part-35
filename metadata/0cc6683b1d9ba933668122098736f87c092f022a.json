But since the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infancy, there has also been an upward\nevolution that includes tighter musicianship, increased songwriting smarts and a\nhigh-octane stage show regarded by fans at sold out shows from coast to coast.\nJust trace the progression from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tracksuit wearing days on 2000Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s\nself-titled release to the plethora of puns on their breakthrough sophomore\nrelease The Anatomy of the Tongue and Cheek to the Billboard Top 200 album\ncharting Two Lefts DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Make a RightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦But Three Do (#38 street week debut) and\nitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evident that Relient K thrive on raising the bar with each release.\n\nTheir latest offering MMHMM is no exception demonstrating yet another building\nblock upon the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reliable recipe. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a natural progression from\nthe first onto the second, third and now the fourth record,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ notes drummer Dave\nDouglas. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The change has come incrementally with each disc. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel like\nweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re taking a drastic number of turns, but the direction keeps shifting for the\nbetter.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe reunion with longtime producer Mark Townsend comes at a time when lines are\nbeing blurred between the post hardcore, post punk and peak emo movements,\nmaking Relient KÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original output level especially attention grabbing. Such\nsounds are amplified all the more courtesy of mixers Tom Lord-Alge (U2, The\nRolling Stones, Oasis) on Ã¢â‚¬Å“The One IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Waiting For,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“High of 75,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“My\nGirlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ex-Boyfriend,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and J.R. McNeely (UnderOath, Project 86, Demon Hunter ) on\nthe rest of the tracks. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I feel like with this record when weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re rocking heavy,\nweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re rocking heavier than we ever have and when weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re letting up with low key\nmoments, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more mellow then weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done in the past. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hitting our peaks\ncorrectly and all the angles are really paying off,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Thiessen.\n\nAs for the messages behind such sparse pre-production sessions, Thiessen turned\nto the basic root of his personality, a combination of satire and seriousness\nthat runs the gamut between relationships, geography, faith and the weather.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my personality to be cheesy and tell dumb jokes,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he admits. Ã¢â‚¬Å“For the last\nfour of five years, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve taken all the puns I think of on a daily basis and\nplant them in a song. Besides that tone, this record also has personal ties.\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot about making mistakes, failing, how amazing grace is and picking\nyourself back up.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Who I Am Hates Who IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve BeenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ launches with a reflective piano arrangement that\nbuilds up with intensity to address lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moments when everything seems to be\nfailing, while reminding all that God provides second chances. The potent Ã¢â‚¬Å“This\nWeek, The TrendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ speaks of breaking through daily routine and living each day to\nits adventurous fullest, the spunky Ã¢â‚¬Å“Maintain ConsciousnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a colorful\ncommentary on societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s need to be constantly stimulated by technology and the\nblasting Ã¢â‚¬Å“ApatheticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ calls all to tone down their obsession over possessions.\n\nThere are also plenty of power chords that fall on the lighter side of the\ntopical fence, from the brooding vibe of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life After Death and TaxesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the\nhysterically framed Ã¢â‚¬Å“My GirlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ex-BoyfriendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the thermometer based teasing of\nthe bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home state (Ohio) on Ã¢â‚¬Å“High of 75.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I So Hate ConsequencesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seems to\nbuild a bridge between the two writing styles, comically addressing all the\ntimes we make mistakes and try to run from them, but also coming to the\nrealization that repentance and forgiveness are necessary components in the\nhealing process.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not trying to hide anything with the songs on this record, just to get\nwhat we feel out there,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Thiessen summarizes. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also found it to be the\nhardest thing in the world to say Ã¢â‚¬ËœJesusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in a song and not be cheesy, so we\ndefinitely have our own way of singing about spirituality. But in the end thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nwho we are and what we believe in. We hope between that and the music, it\nconnects with someone out there.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cc6683b1d9ba933668122098736f87c092f022a","amp;dn":"Relient_K-Five_Score_and_Seven_Years_Ago-2007-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cc6683b1d9ba933668122098736f87c092f022a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,198,104,59,29,155,169,51,102,129,34,9,135,54,248,124,9,47,2,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
