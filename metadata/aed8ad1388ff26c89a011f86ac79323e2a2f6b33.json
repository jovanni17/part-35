Two producers with a vast knowledge of Funk, Breaks &amp; Beats, Hip-hop and Reggae soon joined forces to create a unique sound all their own, a combination of the Hip-hop and Jazz worlds which fused dusty breaks with live horns, guitar, and bass.\n\nThis sound culminated on their debut release Choked Up and in 2003 they returned to the lab for the underrated Twice as Nice LP before going their separate ways.\n\n1.
