In the simplest of terms, \nDinosaur Jr. proved that they could return on Beyond and that they could still be vital but, on Farm, \nthey actually are back, do sound vital and clearly have captivating muses worth chasing. \nThe proof of all of those things lies in all twelve of Farm's tracks; fans can only hope they do it \nmore than just this once.\n\n------------------------\n\nFound this and thought it needed to be distributed, enjoy.\n\n\n\n----------\n\nGood music, Check     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/budakrist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/budakrist&lt;/a&gt; \nto see what else I've seeded.\n\nEnjoy, and try to seed something of your own it's easy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e612aeb5d794a0246218e4114710459025e29e32","amp;dn":"Dinosaur_Jr-Farm-2009-420","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e612aeb5d794a0246218e4114710459025e29e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,18,174,181,215,148,160,36,98,24,228,17,71,16,69,144,37,226,158,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
