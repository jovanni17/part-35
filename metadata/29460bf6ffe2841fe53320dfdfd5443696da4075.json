Daniel's jaggedly tuneful pop merges with Boeckner's rock classicism for a nervy chemical reaction on songs like the scuzzed-up synth-pop &quot;My Love Is Real&quot; and the neo-garage rock stomp &quot;Would That Not Be Nice.&quot; But the secret weapon might be drummer Sam Brown, formerly of Ohio punks New Bomb Turks, who bashes and swings with wrecking-ball force. Let's hope this isn't a one-time thing.\n\nTracklist\n\n\n01 My Love Is Real \t2:49\n02 FlagginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ A Ride  \t3:47\n03 What Gets You Alone  \t3:01\n04 Would That Not Be Nice \t4:02\n05 The Salton Sea  \t4:21\n06 Baby Get Worse  \t4:16\n07 Civilian Stripes     \t2:27\n08 For Your Heart   \t5:39\n09 Shivers    \t              4:55\n10 Like Ice Cream  \t3:34\n11 Neopolitans  \t              3:59","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29460bf6ffe2841fe53320dfdfd5443696da4075","amp;dn":"Divine+Fits-+%282012%29+A+thing+called+Divine+Fits++Projeto+Chernoby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29460bf6ffe2841fe53320dfdfd5443696da4075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,70,11,246,255,226,132,31,229,51,32,223,223,213,68,54,150,218,64,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
