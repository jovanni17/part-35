This movie had a small budget, but is so hilarious and clever that you'll forget about that. It's a parody of exploitation and those old sci-fi movies from the '50s and '60s. So much cardboard and aluminum foil. This is a rip from a screener DVD that was submitted to a film festival. I used handbrake.\n\nPsycho Bettys From Planet Pussycat\n\nTwenty years ago, a virus killed off all of the males on Planet Pussycat. Faced with inevitable extinction, Queen Betty of Pussycat hatched a plan to save her loyal subjects - the remaining population, known as Bettys. After receiving Earth's television signals, four chosen Bettys traveled to Earth in search of men for procreation or dismemberment. Written, directed and music by Aaron Hendren, Psycho Bettys From Planet Pussycat stars Katy Houska, Hannah Kauffmann, Lauren Poole, Rachael Shapiro, Serouj Bingham, Gilbert Sanchez and Nate Warren.
