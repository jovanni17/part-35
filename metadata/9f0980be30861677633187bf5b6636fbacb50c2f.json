It is a call-in and variety show hosted by Chris Gethard that airs every Wednesday night at 11:00PM on MNN and on a live stream at the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website. The Public access television show is written and produced by Noah Forman, Dru Johnston, J.D. Amato and Chris Gethard. It is directed by J.D. Amato. The show, known for its &quot;no cool kids&quot; atmosphere, has been called &quot;oddly uplifting&quot;, a &quot;cult hit,&quot; &quot;an often riveting experiment in seat-of-your-pants broadcasting,&quot; and has gained viewers from around the world. On November 20, 2013, it was announced that Comedy Central had ordered a pilot for prospective addition to their lineup.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f0980be30861677633187bf5b6636fbacb50c2f","amp;dn":"The+Chris+Gethard+Show+-+Episode+%23123+-+%28480p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f0980be30861677633187bf5b6636fbacb50c2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,9,128,190,48,134,22,119,99,49,135,191,91,102,54,251,172,181,12,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
