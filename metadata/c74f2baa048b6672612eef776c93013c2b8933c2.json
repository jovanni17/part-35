The distance between these islands can be huge - literally hundreds or thousands of miles - but somehow, life made it there. Isolation does curious things - animals evolve and adapt in strange ways. \n\n\nWitness flesh-eating caterpillars, giant crabs capable of opening coconuts, geckos that can breed without any need of a male, frogs that have never been tadpoles... Beyond cliched images of swaying palms and idyllic beaches, this is the real, immense and surprising South Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Benedict Cumberbatch\n=================================\n\n\nProduced by: Huw Cordey\n=======================\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: South Pacific\nYear.................: 2009\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:58:43 (  ) 00:59:13 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: (AC3) \nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 704x400 \nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1761 kbit/s ( ) 1775 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: External English\nFile Size:...........: 745 MB ( ) 746 MB\nFPS..................: 29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 2009\nParts................: 6 Episodes\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458521/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458521/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458521/episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458521/episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n\n\n\n    Episodes:\n    =========\n\n\n 1) Ocean Of Islands\n 2) Castaways\n 3) Endless Blue\n 4) Ocean of Volcanoes\n 5) Strange Islands\n 6) Fragile Paradise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click on DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s) on my older torrents instead,thank you.\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c74f2baa048b6672612eef776c93013c2b8933c2","amp;dn":"South+Pacific-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c74f2baa048b6672612eef776c93013c2b8933c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,79,43,170,4,139,102,114,97,46,239,119,108,147,1,60,43,137,51,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
