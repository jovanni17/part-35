Thanks Kirill!\n\nThis is only 128kbps but sounds good, there doesn't seem to be another option out there.\n\nI will keep this torrent alive, but my upload speed is utterly slow, so please help your fellow downloaders by seeding as long as you can. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:092dd9241bac2480f8567b0f95a0aaf1e8c3fd81","amp;dn":"divine+divinity+soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"092dd9241bac2480f8567b0f95a0aaf1e8c3fd81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,45,217,36,27,172,36,128,248,86,123,15,149,160,170,241,232,195,253,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
