Many of these subsequent events represent the logical unfolding of decisions taken and post-Cold War policies inaugurated during the conflicts of the 1990:s in the former Yugoslavia, and yet these are conflicts that are among the least understood and the most frequently misrepresented in mainstream media...\n\n\nNOTE: This is an updated version of the old torrent with the same name. This time I've added one more book to the collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15e8f46e4c6d694cc84d64d04d4736fee087b63","amp;dn":"US%2FEU+Interventionism+in+the+Balkans+-+Critical+Source+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15e8f46e4c6d694cc84d64d04d4736fee087b63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,94,143,70,228,198,214,148,204,132,214,77,4,212,115,111,238,8,123,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
