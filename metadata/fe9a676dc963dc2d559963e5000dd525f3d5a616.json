Drag an app into your applications folder, and it's installed. You'd think it would be that easy to delete an app ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ just a matter of dragging it to the trash. But it's not. Apps install support files on your computer that generate clutter. Introducing AppZapper. Simply drag one or more apps onto AppZapper. Then, watch as it finds the extra files and lets you delete them with one click.\n\n\n\nThis version is for Snow Leopard [10.6].\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Show you appreciation by SEEDING! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe9a676dc963dc2d559963e5000dd525f3d5a616","amp;dn":"AppZapper+2.0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe9a676dc963dc2d559963e5000dd525f3d5a616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,154,103,109,201,99,220,45,85,153,99,229,0,13,213,37,243,213,166,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
