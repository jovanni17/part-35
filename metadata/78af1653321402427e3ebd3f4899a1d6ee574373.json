But on a vacation alone, the couple perishes in a flight over the Grand Canyon. After the funeral, their daughters, Ruthie and Julia, are shocked by the provisions in their willÃ¢â‚¬Â¦not the least of which is that they are to be separated.\n\nSpanning nearly two decades, the sistersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ journeys take them from their familiar home in Atlanta to sophisticated bohemian San Francisco, a mountain town in Virginia, the campus of Berkeley, and lofts in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. As they heal from loss, search for love, and begin careers, their sisterhood, once an oasis, becomes complicated by resentment, anger, and jealousy. It seems as though the echoes of their parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ deaths will never stop reverberatingÃ¢â‚¬â€until another shocking accident changes everything once again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78af1653321402427e3ebd3f4899a1d6ee574373","amp;dn":"A+Soft+Place+to+Land+-+Susan+Rebecca+White.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78af1653321402427e3ebd3f4899a1d6ee574373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,175,22,83,50,20,2,66,126,62,189,63,72,153,161,214,238,87,67,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
