It is set on the turn of the millennium, and features Lord Blackadder placing a bet with his friends ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ modern versions of Queenie (Miranda Richardson), Melchett (Stephen Fry), George (Hugh Laurie) and Darling (Tim McInnerny) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that he has built a working time machine. While this is intended as a clever con trick, the machine, surprisingly, works, sending Blackadder and Baldrick back to the time of the dinosaurs, where they manage to cause the extinction of the dinosaurs, through the use of Baldrick's best, worst and only pair of underpants as a weapon against a hungry T.Rex. Finding that Baldrick has forgotten to write dates on the machine's dials, the rest of the film follows their attempts to find their way back to 1999, often creating huge historical anomalies in the process which must be corrected before the end. The film includes cameo appearances from Kate Moss and Colin Firth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a71db77564b86a1c15569993ac3ee2474c5a42e","amp;dn":"Blackadder+-+Back+%26+Forth+%28Millennium+Special%2C+1999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a71db77564b86a1c15569993ac3ee2474c5a42e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,113,219,119,86,75,134,161,193,85,105,153,58,195,238,36,116,197,164,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
