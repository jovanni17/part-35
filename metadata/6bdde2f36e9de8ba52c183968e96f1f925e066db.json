Grandmix 83 Blast-off \n\nAbout the \\\\\\&quot;Directors Cut\\\\\\&quot;\nThe Grandmix 83 \\\\\\&quot;Directors Cut\\\\\\&quot; now ends with \\\\\\&quot;Living on Video\\\\\\&quot; by Trans-X\nTracks 69 to 77 were in the original mix, but not broadcasted due to the maximum time available in 1983.\nAs the mix now runs on for 4 more tracks, it will be more complete than the one broadcasted in 1983.\nAmong the tracks removed from the very end are \\\\\\&quot;Zarah - Nina Hagen\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;Beat it - Michael Jackson\\\\\\&quot;\n\\\\\\&quot;Maniac - Michael Sembello\\\\\\&quot;and some obscure tracks I don\\\\\\'t even remember.\nBelieve me nothing worth keeping is lost here, as these extra tracks were only in the mix to make sure it\nwas at least one full hour. Consider this to be the final \\\\\\&quot;Directors Cut\\\\\\&quot;of the Grandmix 83","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bdde2f36e9de8ba52c183968e96f1f925e066db","amp;dn":"Grandmix+1983+%28directors+cut%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bdde2f36e9de8ba52c183968e96f1f925e066db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,221,226,243,110,157,232,186,82,193,131,150,142,150,241,249,37,224,102,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
