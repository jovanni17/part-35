He tends a remote farm and looks after his ailing father. Theirs is a brittle, tight-lipped relationship. When his father moves ever closer towards the grave, Helmer shifts him upstairs. He then clears out all the junk from the ground floor, throws the house plants on the dung heap, orders a new bed, and begins to live a life of his own. From time to time, Ada from the neighbouring farm drops in with her sons, and the milk truck driver regularly seeks HelmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s company Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but Helmer withdraws into his own world. He paints his late brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s room and moves in Henk, an eighteen-year-old farmhand. These steps are all undertaken to make a stand against his father. But his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unfulfilled expectations continue to hinder HelmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotional well-being. Henk, however, responds to HelmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clouded feelings with fond openness. And the milk truck driver canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to forget Helmer either. \n\n\nBoven.in.het.stil.DVDRip.x264.MKO.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 1 663 Kbps\nLength            : 1.01 GiB for 1h 27mn 11s 40ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC\nAspect            : 720 x 552 (1.855)\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : nl\n\n\nMy rip.
