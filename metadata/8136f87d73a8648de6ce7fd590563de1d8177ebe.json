It presents splitting multiscale methods to solve multiscale and multiphysics problems and describes analytical and numerical methods in time and space for evolution equations arising in engineering problems.\n\nThe book discusses the effectiveness, simplicity, stability, and consistency of the methods in solving problems that occur in real-life engineering tasks. It shows how MATLABÃ‚Â® and SimulinkÃ‚Â® are used to implement the methods. The author also covers the coupling of separate, multiple, and logical scales in applications, including microscale, macroscale, multiscale, and multiphysics problems.\n\nCovering mathematical, algorithmic, and practical aspects, this book brings together innovative ideas in coupled systems and extends standard engineering tools to coupled models in materials and flow problems with respect to their scale dependencies and their influence on each time and spatial scale","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8136f87d73a8648de6ce7fd590563de1d8177ebe","amp;dn":"Coupled+Systems+-+Theory%2C+Models%2C+and+Applications+in+Engineerin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8136f87d73a8648de6ce7fd590563de1d8177ebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,54,248,125,115,168,100,141,230,206,127,213,144,86,61,225,216,23,126,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
