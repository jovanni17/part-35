It is a revolution that keeps mothers and babies alive, helps children grow, and enables adults to thrive.\r\n\r\nMillions Saved: New Cases of Proven Success in Global Health chronicles the global health revolution from the ground up, showcasing twenty-two local, national, and regional health programs that have been part of this global change. The book profiles eighteen remarkable cases in which large-scale efforts to improve health in low- and middle-income countries succeeded, and four examples of promising interventions that fell short of their health targets when scaled-up in real world conditions. Each case demonstrates how much effortâ€”and sometimes luckâ€”is required to fight illness and sustain good health.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe epub has been tested in Calibre for PC [Windows], and Moonplus Reader for Android; the mobi file has been tested in Mobipocket Reader for Windows, Kindle for Windows and Kindle for Android","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a1b4d52ca4a0076fdb6a75d9ce786bffdc41eb7","amp;dn":"Millions+Saved+by+Amanda+Glassman+Miriam+Temin+KS49+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a1b4d52ca4a0076fdb6a75d9ce786bffdc41eb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,27,77,82,202,74,0,118,253,182,167,93,156,231,134,191,253,196,30,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
