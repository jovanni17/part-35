HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why:\n\nReliability: The unique connection manager monitors for busy servers or dropped/stalled connections and will re-connect and resume transfers from where they left off. Firewalls are traversed with ease, due to the automatic FTP mode detection system. Misbehaving servers are pandered to in order to get the job done. Other apps simply display an error message.\n\nFlexibility: Yummy FTP takes all the best standard features available in other solutions, makes them better, then adds a bunch of its own uniquely powerful features, resulting in a highly focused and productive feature set. You wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find any bloat here. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also compatible with a wide range of servers from the FTP server built into Mac OS X, to Windows, Unix, and even XBox and Dec VMS servers, which fits nicely with its ability to customize settings on a per-server basis.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fast: And itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s efficient too, using minimal CPU resources at all times. To demonstrate, we tested Yummy FTP against three major competitors: Fetch, Transmit and Interarchy.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nNew Features\n\n* Support for Lion, featuring fullscreen mode\n\n* Logging\n\nEnhancements\n\n* Added support for DiffFork as a diff app\n\n* Added support for Transmit 4 favorites import\n\n* Added AppleScript support for toggling scheduled items\n\n* FTP Watcher now checks if files are in use before uploading\n\n* Selected Protocol is now remembered in the New Connection window\n\n* Sync Preview now reports when file sizes differ\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n* Fixed support for DeltaWalker as a diff app\n\n* Bookmarks can no longer be given an empty name\n\n* Edit With... command was broken for non-English systems\n\n* QuickEdit window stored size now self-adjusts if monitor settings are\n  changed\n\n* AppleScript download command now correctly accepts lists of items\n  when the optional destination parameter is specified\n\n* HTTPS keychain passwords are no longer used if present\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X.4.11+\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb49d6a2fb521efd8d3e618bdf4326ff3637933b","amp;dn":"Yummp+FTP+v.+1.8.5+%2B+%5BK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb49d6a2fb521efd8d3e618bdf4326ff3637933b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,73,214,162,251,82,30,253,141,62,97,139,223,67,38,255,54,55,147,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
