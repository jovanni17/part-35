Like now-undisputed group leader Kerry Livgren, Elefante was a born-again Christian, however, and his involvement in the songwriting turned the group decisively toward religious lyrical sentiments, often of a judgmental, us-versus-you nature. It&amp;#039;s possible that fans who had been happy to accept the notion that &quot;we are dust in the wind&quot; were less patient with the ideas expressed in Elefante&amp;#039;s &quot;Face It&quot; (&quot;How many times do I have to tell you?&quot;) or Livgren&amp;#039;s &quot;(You&amp;#039;re Standing on The) Borderline.&quot; Or maybe it was just that it was getting hard to distinguish Kansas from Foreigner and Journey. In any case, Vinyl Confessions was Kansas&amp;#039; first album since their debut not to go gold.
