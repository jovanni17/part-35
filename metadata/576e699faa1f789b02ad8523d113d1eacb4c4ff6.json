Geisha is the futuristic tale of Jomi Sohodo, an android with a knack for painting. Adopted early on by the Kami family, Jomi has been assimilated into regular human life - or so she thinks. Society, for all its advances, still regards her as an outcast, as something less than human. This makes it rather difficult for her to sell her paintings, and if she can't do that, she's going to have to find another way to pay her rent.\n\nCreated by Andi Watson (Skeleton Key).\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:576e699faa1f789b02ad8523d113d1eacb4c4ff6","amp;dn":"Geisha+%28Oni+Press%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"576e699faa1f789b02ad8523d113d1eacb4c4ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,110,105,159,170,31,120,155,2,173,133,35,209,19,209,234,203,76,79,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
