The brothers were separated by almost a generation and never recorded together. Speckled Red and Piano Red both played in a raucous good time barrelhouse boogie-woogie style, although the elder Red played slow blues more often. Both recorded versions of &quot;The Right String (But the Wrong Yo-Yo)&quot;, Speckled Red first in 1930, and the younger scored a big hit with the song 20-years later.\nThe family moved for brief periods during his early-to-mid teenage years to Detroit, Michigan, then Atlanta, Georgia after his father violated Jim Crow laws, before settling in Hampton, Georgia, where his birth was eventually registered some time later. The family itself, consisting of Perryman and 7 brothers and sisters, had little musical background, though Speckled Red was a self-taught piano player[2] (influenced primarily by his idol Fishtail, along with Charlie Spand, James Hemingway and Will Ezell, and inspired at his earliest point by Paul Seminole in a movie theatre) and also learned the organ at his local church\nBy his mid-teens he was already playing house parties and juke joints, and moved back to Detroit in his mid-20s to play anywhere he could, including nightclubs and brothels, and was noticed by a Brunswick Records talent scout just before he left for Memphis, Tennessee, where he was located by Jim Jackson. It was here where he cut his first recording sessions, resulting in two classics for Brunswick in &quot;Wilkins Street Stomp&quot; and the hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Dirty DozensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The following year, 1930, he recorded again, this time in Chicago, Illinois, resulting in most notably ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Dirty Dozens No. 2,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which was not nearly as successful and the pianist was without a contract or label and again playing making the rounds at Memphis venues and St. Louis bars.\nHis 1938 session work in Aurora, Illinois with slide guitar player Robert Nighthawk and mandolinist Willie Hatcher for Bluebird Records was steady and long but also unsuccessful, and sometime after during the 1940s moved back to St. Louis and continued his career of playing taverns, as well working the public produce market doing manual labor until the servicemen returned home to heavy lifting jobs.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - House Dance Blues - 3:12\n02 - The Dirty Dozen - 3:21\n03 - Wilkins Street Stomp - 2:55\n04 - The Dirty Dozen -- No. 2 - 3:04\n05 - We Got to Get That Fixed - 2:53\n06 - Speckled Red's Blues - 2:42\n07 - The Right String -- But the Wrong Yo Yo - 2:32\n08 - Lonesome Mind Blues - 2:58\n09 - Welfare Blues - 3:23\n10 - Down on the Levee - 3:17\n11 - Do the Georgia - 3:12\n12 - Early in the Morning - 3:27\n13 - Take It Easy - 3:09\n14 - Try Me One More Time - 3:31\n15 - Louise Baltimore Blues - 3:17\n16 - What Makes You Treat Me So Mean? - 3:12\n17 - St. Louis Stomp - 3:19\n18 - You Got to Fix It - 3:17\n19 - They're Mean to Me - 3:06\n20 - So Unkind - 3:15\n21 - Dad's Piece - 2:20\n22 - Oh Red - 2:13\n23 - Early in the Morning - 3:58\n\nPersonnel:\nSonny Boy Williamson - harmonica\nRobert Lee McCoy - guitar\nRufus &quot;Speckled Red&quot; Perryman - vocals, piano\nWillie Hatcher - mandolin\n\nRecorded in Memphis, Tennessee, Chicago, Illinois, and St. Louis, Missouri.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b39af3f058cf4654eaa678d99c1bd54b454f4256","amp;dn":"Speckled+Red+Complete+Recordings+1929-1938%28blues%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b39af3f058cf4654eaa678d99c1bd54b454f4256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,154,243,240,88,207,70,84,234,166,120,217,156,27,213,75,69,79,66,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
