Ever wonder why a peanut butter    \n         sandwich sticks to the roof of your mouth? Did you know       \n         baby carrots might all be purple if it weren't for the        \n         Dutch? What mysterious filling other than vanilla creme       \n         used to be inside a Twinkie? Host Bobby Bognar seeks out      \n         the answers to these and other intriguing questions as        \n         he travels across America uncovering the secrets of our       \n         favorite lunch box treats. Along the way, he discovers        \n         everything from how the juice starts flowing into a juice     \n         box before it has a bottom to hold it...to the surprise       \n         that awaits us if we look inside a Goldfish cracker after     \n          we bite it.                                                   \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
