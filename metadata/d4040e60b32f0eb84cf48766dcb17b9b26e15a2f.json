It was co-written by Adrian Smith, Bruce Dickinson and Steve Harris. It was co-produced by Kevin Shirley and Harris. The title is inspired by the British cult film of the same name. The song should not be confused with &quot;Wicker Man&quot; from Dickinson's solo career, the lyrics of which are more closely themed around the film. The latter song can be found on the 2 disc edition of The Best of Bruce Dickinson.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (Adrian Smith, Steve Harris, Bruce Dickinson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:35\n    &quot;Futureal (live - Helsinki Ice Hall, September 1999)&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:58\n    &quot;Man on the Edge (live - Filaforum, Milano, September 1999)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:37","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4040e60b32f0eb84cf48766dcb17b9b26e15a2f","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+The+Wicker+Man+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4040e60b32f0eb84cf48766dcb17b9b26e15a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,4,14,96,179,47,14,184,76,244,135,102,220,177,123,155,38,225,90,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
