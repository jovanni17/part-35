With an 'access all areas' backstage pass, Josie D'Arby and singer, pianist and songwriter Joe Stilgoe present coverage of the final.\r\n\r\nOn stage: saxophone and recorder player Tom Ridout, his sister Alexandra Ridout on trumpet, pianists Elliott Sansom and Noah Stoneman, and saxophonist Tom Smith. They are joined by one of the country's finest jazz bands, the Gwilym Simcock Trio.\r\n\r\nThe result: some remarkable performances that make you forget that all the competitors are all between 15 and 21 years of age. One of them will walk away as the winner of the BBC Young Musician jazz award.\r\n\r\nMaking the all-important decision is a panel of judges with all the right credentials: pianist and broadcaster Julian Joseph, saxophonist Tim Garland, composer and pianist Zoe Rahman, trumpeter Bryon Wallen and singer and composer Gwyneth Herbert.\r\n\r\nBroadcast: 13th May 2016\r\nDuration: 120 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f9958d4a41aae1363880984916cffd74c94bd81","amp;dn":"BBC+Young+Musician+2016%2C+jazz+award+final","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f9958d4a41aae1363880984916cffd74c94bd81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,153,88,212,164,26,174,19,99,136,9,132,145,108,255,215,76,148,189,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
