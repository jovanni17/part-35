Also, a good portion of the tracks were penned by Wechter. The liveliest tracks are the title track and &quot;How Much Is That Doggie In The Window&quot;. The others are nice, but don't quite have the same amount of &quot;oomph&quot;. One notable track is &quot;Las Mananitas&quot;, which would resurface in a nearly identical version on the Tijuana Brass Christmas Album. The cover is another work of Baja art, this time in cartoon form. It basically steals images from the first album--Alpert's visage with shades, under a sombrero with the number &quot;one&quot; on it, and Jerry Moss wearing the other number one sombrero. There's also a likeness of Sharon Alpert, and I can only imagine that the lady wearing only a snake and high heels might be Cissy Wechter! Of course, off in one corner, an amigo is watering the flowers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ddebd12d63289b3ef3db8dbf8606e94abb1daa4","amp;dn":"Baja+Marimba+Band+-+For+Animals+Only","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ddebd12d63289b3ef3db8dbf8606e94abb1daa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,222,189,18,214,50,137,179,239,61,184,219,248,96,110,148,171,177,218,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
