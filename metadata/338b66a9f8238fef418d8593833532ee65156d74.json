He is an absurdist spoof of comic book superheroes. After its creation, the character spun off into an independent comic book series in 1988, and gained mainstream popularity through an animated TV series on Fox in 1994. A short-lived live-action TV series, video game, and various merchandise have also been based on the character. The Tick has been well received as a comic book character.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:338b66a9f8238fef418d8593833532ee65156d74","amp;dn":"The+Tick+++%28Season+2+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"338b66a9f8238fef418d8593833532ee65156d74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,139,102,169,248,35,143,239,65,141,133,147,131,53,50,238,101,21,109,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
