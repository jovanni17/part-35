Cameron, Raghu. Raman (Elsevier, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0121569322\r\n\r\nProcess Systems Risk Management provides complete coverage of risk management concepts and applications for safe design and operation of industrial and other process facilities. The whole life cycle of the process or product is taken into account, from its conception to decommissioning.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of human factors in risk management is also treated, ranging from personnel and public safety to environmental impact and business interruption. This unique approach to process risk management is firmly grounded in systems\r\nengineering. Numerous examples are used to illustrate important concepts -drawn from almost 40 years authorsâ€™ experience in risk analysis, assessment and management, with applications in both on- and off-shore operations.\r\n\r\nThis book is essential reading on the relevant techniques to tackle risk management activities for small-, medium- and large-scale operations in the process industries. It is aimed at informing a wide audience of industrial risk management practitioners, including plant managers, engineers, health professionals, town planners, and administrators of regulatory agencies. \r\n\r\n* A computational perspective on the risk management of chemical processes\r\n* A multifaceted approach that includes the technical, social, human and management factors\r\n* Includes numerous examples and illustrations from real life incidents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c8a49afcd55256d0c9775dc44475f5d9156c13b","amp;dn":"Process+Systems+Risk+Management","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c8a49afcd55256d0c9775dc44475f5d9156c13b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,138,73,175,205,85,37,109,12,151,117,220,68,71,95,93,145,86,193,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
