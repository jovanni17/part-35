Fall From Grace is uncompromising, dare I say, old school, power metal. Heavy and intense, Borealis is relentless from the gate, but in a very good way. They're forceful yet still maintain developed melodic lines and some compositional intrigue.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Finest Hour  (04:01), 11.67 MB\n02. Words I Failed To Say  (05:13), 14.43 MB\n03.
