The film is dedicated to this french author, forefather of the Surrealists, who developped a formal constraint system to generate inspiration from dislocative puns.\nDali does the very same thing with this chimerical pseudocumentary leading us to the mysterious realm of High Mongolia where a gigantic white soft mushroom grows, many times more hallucinogen than LSD! From his studio-museum in CadacÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨s (Spain), he proceeds to report on the alleged scientific expedition sent out by himself to retrieve this precious treasure, with newspaper clips and newsreel. Childhood memories are the opportunity to explain more throughoutly the source of his inspiration. This bucolic landscape is in fact a close up of Hitler's portrait turned to the side!\nWholly daliesque, this film experiment piece together astonishing combinations on superimposed images, fading in and out, switching scale with odd perspectives. Dali invents a filmmaking process and apply his very language to cinematic purposes, bending the rules to serve his desperate need for originality. Travelling through a microscopic close up of paintings or rough surfaces, his voiceover commentary gives sense to the landscapes taking form under his eyes. We get the chance to see some of his art, and watch the artist being his egotico-paranoid self (in french). A delirious experience, beautifully crafted. The backdoor into Salvador Dali's twisted mind.\n\n***\n\nIn any list of films IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d currently most like to see but canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t due to lack of availability, this bizarre ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdocumentaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ collaboration between Salvador DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ and JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Montes-Baquer would be near the top of the list. I saw it once, probably shortly after it had been made, when the BBC screened it as part of their Omnibus arts series in the late seventies. By this time I was already very familiar with the Surrealists, DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­, Magritte and Max Ernst especially, so it was great to see DalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ himself declaring a supposed mission to explore Upper Mongolia in a search for giant hallucinogenic mushrooms. This premise aside, I remember few other details, the whole film was as delightfully confusing as might be expected.\n\n***\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRousselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most famous works are Impressions of Africa and Locus Solus, both written according to formal constraints based on homonymic puns. Roussel kept this compositional method a secret until the publication of his posthumous text, How I Wrote Certain of My Books, where he describes it as follows: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI chose two similar words. For example billiards and pilliards (looter). Then I added to it words similar but taken in two different directions, and I obtained two almost identical sentences thus. The two found sentences, it was a question of writing a tale which can start with the first and finish by the second. Amplifying the process then, I sought new words reporting itself to the word billiards, always to take them in a different direction than that which was presented first of all, and that provided me each time a creation moreover. The process evolved/moved and I was led to take an unspecified sentence, of which I drew from the images by dislocating it, a little as if it had been a question of extracting some from the drawings of rebus.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ For example, Les lettres du blanc sur les bandes du vieux billard/The white letters on the cushions of the old billiard tableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ must somehow reach the phrase, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦les lettres du blanc sur les bandes du vieux pillard/letters [written by] a white man about the hordes of the old plunderer.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nbut I have read that he slowly commited suicide by taking small amounts of posion knowing just when it would be fatal enough to finally kill him\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPerhaps not surprisingly, Roussel was unpopular during his lifetime and critical reception of his works was almost unanimously negativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nStill he did manage to make it into The A-Z of Great Writers by Tom Payne which is where I found out about him.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe made his system known posthumously, sending the manuscript of How I wrote Some of My Books to be published after his death - which he timed by increasing his dosages of barbituates until they killed him. Even his end was part of a plan whose author never seemed eager tto let it be understoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
