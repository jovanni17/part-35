Pieces like &quot;The Hunt,&quot; &quot;Feeding Time,&quot; and the main titles are variations on the film's primary musical motif, which was also interpreted by Andy Williams in his rendition of the film's title song. Barry's expressive arrangements and melodies convey the vibrant (&quot;Playtime,&quot; &quot;Elsa at Play&quot;) and dangerous (&quot;Killing at Kiunga,&quot; &quot;Elephant Stampede&quot;) aspects of African wildlife. Like the film itself, Born Free's score is lively and moving without becoming forced or saccharine.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Main Title - Born Free (02:39)\n02. The Hunt (03:14)\n03.
