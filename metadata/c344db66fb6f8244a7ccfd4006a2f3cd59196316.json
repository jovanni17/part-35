One of the first acts to establish a\n\nmusical identity based completely around the use of synthesizers, Depeche Mode began their existence as a bouncy dance-pop outfit but gradually developed a darker, more dramatic\n\nsound that ultimately positioned them as one of the most successful alternative bands of their era.\n\nThe roots of Depeche Mode date to 1976, when Basildon, England-based keyboardists Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher first teamed to form the group No Romance in China. The band\n\nproved short-lived, and by 1979 Clarke had formed French Look, another duo featuring guitarist/keyboardist Martin Gore; Fletcher soon signed on, and the group rechristened\n\nitself Composition of Sound. Initially, Clarke handled vocal chores, but in 1980 singer David Gahan was brought in to complete the lineup; after one final name change to Depeche\n\nMode, the quartet members jettisoned all instruments excluding their synthesizers, honing a slick, techno-based sound to showcase Clarke&amp;#039;s catchy melodies.\n\nAfter building a following on the London club scene, Depeche Mode debuted in 1980 with &quot;Photographic,&quot; a track included on the Some Bizarre Album label compilation. After\n\nsigning to Mute Records, they issued &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; in early 1981; while neither the single nor its follow-up, &quot;New Life,&quot; caused much of a stir, their third effort, &quot;Just\n\nCan&amp;#039;t Get Enough,&quot; became a Top Ten U.K. hit, and their 1981 debut LP, Speak and Spell, was also a success. Just as Depeche Mode appeared poised for a major commercial\n\nbreakthrough, however, principal songwriter Clarke abruptly exited to form Yazoo with singer Alison Moyet, leaving the group&amp;#039;s future in grave doubt.\n\nAs Gore grabbed the band&amp;#039;s songwriting reins, the remaining trio recruited keyboardist Alan Wilder to fill the technological void created by Clarke&amp;#039;s departure; while 1982&amp;#039;s A\n\nBroken Frame deviated only slightly from Depeche Mode&amp;#039;s earlier work, Gore&amp;#039;s ominous songs grew more assured and sophisticated by the time of 1983&amp;#039;s Construction Time Again.\n\nSome Great Reward, issued the following year, was their artistic and commercial breakthrough, as Gore&amp;#039;s dark, kinky preoccupations with spiritual doubt (&quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot;)\n\nand psychosexual manipulation (&quot;Master and Servant&quot;) came to the fore; the egalitarian single &quot;People Are People&quot; was a major hit on both sides of the Atlantic and typified the\n\nmusic&amp;#039;s turn toward more industrial textures.\n\nReleased in 1986, the atmospheric Black Celebration continued the trend toward grim melancholy and further established the group as a major commercial force. After the superb\n\nsingle &quot;Strangelove,&quot; Depeche Mode issued 1987&amp;#039;s Music for the Masses; a subsequent sold-out tour yielded the 1989 double live set 101 as well as a concert film directed by the\n\nlegendary D.A. Pennebaker. Still, despite an enormous fan base, the group was considered very much an underground cult phenomenon prior to the release of 1990&amp;#039;s Violator, a Top\n\nTen smash that spawned the hits &quot;Enjoy the Silence,&quot; &quot;Policy of Truth,&quot; and &quot;Personal Jesus.&quot;\n\nWith the alternative music boom of the early &amp;#039;90s, Depeche Mode emerged as one of the world&amp;#039;s most successful acts, and their 1993 LP Songs of Faith &amp; Devotion entered the\n\ncharts in the number one slot. However, at the peak of its success, the group began to unravel; first Wilder exited in 1995, and then Gahan was the subject of a failed suicide\n\nattempt. (He later entered a drug rehabilitation clinic to battle an addiction to heroin.) After a four-year layoff, Depeche Mode -- continuing on as a trio -- released 1997&amp;#039;s\n\nUltra, which featured the hits &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and &quot;It&amp;#039;s No Good.&quot; A year later, the band embarked on a tour in support of The Singles 86&gt;98 greatest-hits album. Depeche Mode\n\nplayed 64 shows in 18 countries for over a million fans. It also marked the end of a decade for the band. Each member took some considerable time off, and Depeche Mode would not\n\nregroup for another three years.\n\nExciter, the band&amp;#039;s follow-up to 1997&amp;#039;s Ultra, was released in 2001. Singles such as &quot;Dream On&quot; and &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; did moderately well. Two years later, Gahan issued his debut\n\nsolo album, the dark and sultry Paper Monsters. Gore also followed suit by issuing his debut full-length, CounterfeitÃ‚Â². Each member did respective tours of the U.S. and Europe;\n\nhowever, it wouldn&amp;#039;t be long until Depeche Mode came back together. Playing the Angel became a Top Ten hit upon release in October 2005, produced by Ben Hillier (Doves, Blur,\n\nU2, Elbow). With the success of the &quot;Precious&quot; and &quot;John (The Revelator)&quot; singles, Playing the Angel topped the album charts in 18 countries and went multiple platinum and gold\n\nin 20 countries. Depeche Mode went to on play to 2.5 million fans worldwide, and the special-edition three-disc set Touring the Angel: Live in Milan (2006) captured the essence\n\nof one of the band&amp;#039;s greatest shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD Pressing Information\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel: Mute Records Ltd\nCatalog#: CD STUMM 101\nFormat: 2 x CD\nCountry: UK\nReleased: 1989\nGenre: Electronic\nStyle: Synth-pop\n\n\n\nCredits\n\n\nEngineer - Alan Moulder\nProducer - Depeche Mode\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nRecorded live at The Pasadena Rose Bowl, California, 18-Jun-88..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n101 album review from allmusic.com\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n\n\n\nReview by by Ned Raggett\n\n\n\nAs an event, Depeche Mode&amp;#039;s huge (attendance around 80,000) Los Angeles Rose Bowl concert in 1988 remains legendary; no single artist show had totally sold out the venue\n\nsince eight years beforehand, while the film documentary done by Dylan-filmer D.A. Pennebaker based around the show clearly demonstrated fans&amp;#039; intense commitment to a near-\n\ndecade-old band most mainstream critics continued to stupidly portray as a flash-in-the-pan synth pop effort. This start-to-final-encore record of the concert showcases a band\n\nperfectly able to carry its music from studio to stage as well as any other combo worth its salt should be able to do. Understandably focused on Music for the Masses material,\n\nthe album shows Depeche experimenting with alternate arrangements at various points for live performance; big numbers like &quot;Never Let Me Down Again,&quot; &quot;Stripped,&quot; and\n\n&quot;Blasphemous Rumors&quot; pack even more of a wallop here. Slower numbers and more than a couple of ballads help to vary the hit-packed set, including a fine &quot;Somebody&quot; and &quot;The\n\nThings You Said&quot; combination sung by Martin Gore. &quot;Pleasure Little Treasure,&quot; on record an okay B-side, becomes a monster rocker live, the type of unexpected surprise one could\n\nexpect from a solid band no matter what the music. With a triumphant set of closing numbers, including magnificent takes on &quot;Never Let Me Down Again,&quot; &quot;Master and Servant,&quot; and\n\nthe set-ending &quot;Everything Counts,&quot; with what sounds like the entire audience singing the chorus well after the song has finally ended, 101 does far better at its task than most\n\nmight have guessed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\n\n\n\nDepeche Mode - 101 (1989)\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.
