TheÃ‚Â &quot;Les Chimeres Exquises&quot; album is essentially cinematic but it steps far more with its variegation of stlyes likeÃ‚Â experimental, oriental, ambient, abstract, trip hop, downtempo... \nJean uses huge ammounts of samples with good taste and talent in his music combined with pretty wild grooves sometimes. The album stands out with its delicate sound from todays music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269c540bfd1603912856d323bf4b760239cdda8a","amp;dn":"L%26rsquo%3BOniraunote+-+Les+Chimeres+Exquises+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269c540bfd1603912856d323bf4b760239cdda8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,156,84,11,253,22,3,145,40,86,211,35,191,75,118,2,57,205,218,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
