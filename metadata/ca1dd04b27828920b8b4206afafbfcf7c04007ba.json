But the ship, which may be derelict and full of dangerous occupants, is flying a sovereign flag, and boarding it would be an act of brazen piracy. Nevertheless, the Kapital's first mate, Mag Nagendra, thinks this opportunity is too important to pass by. Do the rules of the old world still apply in this new world, where survival is the law of the land?\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca1dd04b27828920b8b4206afafbfcf7c04007ba","amp;dn":"Massive+06+%28c2c+%26amp%3B+noAds%29+%28theProletariat-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca1dd04b27828920b8b4206afafbfcf7c04007ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,29,208,75,39,130,137,32,184,180,32,106,250,251,252,247,192,64,7,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
