The girls have to follow lots of strange customs, e.g. do not eat or go to the bathroom when a boy is around. Ugly girls have two choices - being bitches and hate boys, or being generally cheap and looked down upon by everyone. The afternoons are spent on the beaches, in the backseats of car or at home-alone-parties where sex and alcohol are the main ingredients. Parents and teachers are trying to straighten the kids out, but that is not easy. \n\n\n\n\nAspect Ratio:  2.35 : 1 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f538297694c61a26af66cf53d7c477664d53af9","amp;dn":"Puberty+Blues+%281981%29+DVD9+Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f538297694c61a26af66cf53d7c477664d53af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,83,130,151,105,76,97,162,106,246,108,245,61,124,71,118,100,213,58,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
