Producer Gil Norton has tightened up the sound considerably -- his control was so tight that drummer William Goldsmith left the band during the recording, leaving Grohl to record the rhythm tracks for the bulk of the album. Certainly, Norton's big, shiny sound makes The Colour and the Shape sound more professional than the debut, but the presence of a full band makes a difference, too. The full Foo Fighters make Grohl's songs heavier, not punkier, which may be a little unsettling to fans of the debut's ragged, amateurish edge. It's also strange that the album has such a glossy, arena-ready sound, since Grohl's songs are introspective, quite different than the endearing punk-pop of its predecessor. They're also not quite as catchy as before, but the band compensates by delivering them with a brutal energy. Still, the lack of immediate hooks prevents The Colour and the Shape from truly catching fire. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1128b86b58f91e61e06f7e3f6634d17d033204da","amp;dn":"Foo+Fighters+-+The+Colour+and+the+Shape%28adonis%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1128b86b58f91e61e06f7e3f6634d17d033204da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,40,184,107,88,249,30,97,224,111,126,63,102,52,209,125,3,50,4,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
