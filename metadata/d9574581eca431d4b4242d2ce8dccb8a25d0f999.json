Like a character from one of her favorite novels, Alice holds a biting, eccentric, but expansive view of life; she wears only white, has a stutter, and knows her peers call her a madwoman in the attic. Various period cures-hydrotherapy, hypnotherapy, electrotherapy, a sanitarium-fail to turn this thirty-two-year-old, highly imaginative, caustically funny woman into one of the silly damsels of 1903's New York Society. Hauntingly, beneath all this lies a dark family secret.\n\nPinkerton's Sister is a novel for readers, who will thrill to recognize a kindred in Alice's references to our most beloved literary characters: Jo March, Jane Eyre, Leo Bloom, and Hester Prynne, among many others, grace these pages. This intertextual, playful work certainly qualifies as &quot;the ultimate book-geek's guilty pleasure&quot; (Creative Loafing Atlanta)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9574581eca431d4b4242d2ce8dccb8a25d0f999","amp;dn":"Pinkerton%27s+Sister+by+Peter+Rushforth+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9574581eca431d4b4242d2ce8dccb8a25d0f999","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,87,69,129,236,164,49,212,180,36,45,44,232,220,203,138,37,208,249,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
