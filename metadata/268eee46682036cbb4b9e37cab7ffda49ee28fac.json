The album serves up a set which captures the inexorable force - and sheer joy - of their live performances, delivered in a format perfect for lounge-rooms, backyards, BBQ's, cafes, road trips and parties all over the world.  This is music which defies definition, but has a sound all of its own.  \n\nThe only thing we can tell you it is that it is incredibly infectious, undeniably uplifting and definitely danceable.\n\n-mESKOJEn-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:268eee46682036cbb4b9e37cab7ffda49ee28fac","amp;dn":"Cat+Empire+-+Cinema","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"268eee46682036cbb4b9e37cab7ffda49ee28fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,142,238,70,104,32,54,203,180,185,227,124,171,127,253,164,158,226,143,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
