Inspired by Guns N&amp;#039; Roses, the Manics decided to rework their working-class angst as heavy arena rock; they seize upon the latent politicism of Guns N&amp;#039; Roses&amp;#039; tortured white-trash metal, interpreting it as a call to arms. Since the Manics are more intellectual and revolutionary than the Gunners, Gold Against the Soul burns with inspired, if confused, rhetoric. The Manics, however, aren&amp;#039;t quite as gifted with hooks at this stage, their power derives from their self-belief, which they can&amp;#039;t quite translate into songs. They are given a bigger, louder production on Gold Against the Soul, which makes the album a more visceral listen than Generation Terrorists, but the songs aren&amp;#039;t as consistently compelling as those on the debut. &quot;From Despair to Where&quot; is a vibrant anthem, and &quot;Drug Drug Druggy,&quot; &quot;Roses in the Hospital,&quot; &quot;Yourself,&quot; and &quot;Sleepflower&quot; all have a similar energy, but the peaks don&amp;#039;t arrive quite as frequently as before. Nevertheless, the rage is more articulate and the sound is stronger, making Gold Against the Soul a flawed but worthy step forward. \n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8be6629092871095f168ad347b0d17d9c290c64c","amp;dn":"Manic+Street+Preachers+-+Gold+Against+The+Soul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8be6629092871095f168ad347b0d17d9c290c64c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,230,98,144,146,135,16,149,241,104,173,52,123,13,23,217,194,144,198,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
