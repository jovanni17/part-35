If stories hold true, I believe this album was the final straw for virtuoso keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who jumped ship shortly after (or was it during?) its release.  I suppose he and I differ in our opinion of the album...\n\nOfficial artist site: http://www.yesworld.com\n\nI highly recommend their live show if you can get out to the next tour, and just about every studio album is exceptional.  Every dvd I&amp;#039;ve seen of theirs - professional, not bootleg - is riveting, kick-ass, and just plain ol&amp;#039; good rock!\n\nJ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebf94c63b596082eae07bb37ad4d4abe67f4afdc","amp;dn":"Yes+-+Tales+From+Topographic+Oceans+CD1+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebf94c63b596082eae07bb37ad4d4abe67f4afdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,249,76,99,181,150,8,46,174,7,187,55,173,77,74,190,103,244,175,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
