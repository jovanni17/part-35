Here are \ntales of innocents caught in the schemes of criminals, detectives \nhunting down truths that hide more lies, gangsters and their women, \nprivate investigators and cops. Here is a world populated by the \nkinds of people who risk their lives to right a wrong, make a buck, \nor save a friend. Included in this collection is Police Band, Dead \nMan's Trail, The Hills of Homicide, and The Sucker Switch.\n\nWritten and performed in the crackling pulp fiction style of the \n1940s and '50s these thrilling, atmospheric stories course with \nauthenticity and bear the mark of a timeless master.\n\n----\n\nLouis L'Amour is the only novelist in history to receive both the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. He \nhas published ninety novels; twenty-nine short-story collections; \ntwo works of nonfiction; a memoir, Education of a Wandering Man; \nand a volume of poetry, Smoke from This Alter. There are more than \n300 million copies of his books in print.\n\n----\n\nStephen Mendel's television credits include appearances on Las \nVegas, 24, and CSI: Miami. His film credits include Miriam, \nProvocateur, Midnight Heat, Jack Frost, and The Terminal. Stephen \nhas appeared on stage in The Foreigner, After Crystal Night, and \nEducating Rita.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ce324f800422fb77fba8f5ceb7c9be439abba53","amp;dn":"Louis+L%5C%27Amour+-+The+Crime+Stories+%5BVolume+06%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ce324f800422fb77fba8f5ceb7c9be439abba53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,227,36,248,0,66,47,183,127,186,143,92,235,124,155,228,57,171,186,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
