Featuring members from outfits such as Ondskapt and Diabolical, both rather prominent bands in their own rights in their respective genres, The AntagonistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fire promises to be quite a ride for fans of Swedish extremity.\nThe album kicks off with some rather mid-paced moments with Betrayal Incarnate, setting up the mood and atmosphere for the album. But the band doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take too long to get things heated up, and as soon as the first blasting of Jocke hit the listener, one quickly draws comparisons with fellow Swedes Watain, especially in the riffing style and that slight Norwegian leaning in the riffing of S.W. One also canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but notice the similarity in A.L.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s gruff growls and that of Erik, and this serves to only strengthen the comparison to Watain.\nHeavy metal influences in black metal seem to be getting increasingly common these days in Swedish black metal, what with the recent efforts of Watain and Acrimonious, and Valkyrja with The AntagonistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fire certainly sits comfortably with these bands as well. Apart from the various instrumentation that results in these comparisons, the way that the songs are structured on The AntagonistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fire and the various elements that are included as well all point towards a more melodic form of black metal. This especially so with the soaring leads and the rather melodic trem-picked sections that S.W. engages in throughout the album. Also, for the most part of the album, rather than the speedy and chaotic style that Dark Funeral or Marduk engage in, Valkyrja chooses a mid-pace, focussing on the atmosphere that is created in the process.\nWhile WatainÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs recent effort in the form of The Wild Hunt failed to really capture my attention (with my favourite still being their previous Lawless Darkness), The AntagonistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fire certainly more than hits the spot, and provides listeners with another face of Swedish black metal.\n\n\n00 album art 01.jpg\t                                       117.18 KB\n01 Betrayal Incarnate.flac 44.1kHz 1083kbps\t                59.24 MB\n02 The Cremating Fire.flac 44.1kHz 1018kbps\t                33.78 MB\n03 Madness Redeemer.flac 44.1kHz 1078kbps\t                40.82 MB\n04 Yearn To Burn.flac 44.1kHz 1034kbps\t                        52.40 MB\n05 Eulogy (Poisoned, Ill And Wounded).flac 44.1kHz 1057kbps\t60.14 MB\n06 Season Of Rot.flac 44.1kHz 1089kbps\t                        50.50 MB\n07 Treading The Path Of The Predator.flac 44.1kHz 1079kbps\t74.35 MB\nThe Antagonist's Fire.cue\t                                  964 bytes\nValkyrja - The Antagonist's Fire.m3u\t                          544 bytes\nz. audiochecker main log file.log\t                         1.62 KB\nz. audiochecker.log\t                                          592 bytes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f962bc2bc035f1965f7a97dd2134840de2bd47aa","amp;dn":"Valkyrja+-+The+Antagonist%27s+Fire+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f962bc2bc035f1965f7a97dd2134840de2bd47aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,98,188,43,192,53,241,150,95,122,151,221,33,52,132,13,226,189,71,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
