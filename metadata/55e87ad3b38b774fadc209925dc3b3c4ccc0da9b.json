It's based on the principle that to write good, high-performance, robust applications you need to understand whats going on deep under the hood. If you are already experienced with writing managed applications and want to learn more about how to get the best from the language at an advanced level, then this is the book for you.\n\nExpert C # 5.0 discusses the familiar C # language in forensic detail. Examining familiar elements closely to reveal how they really work. Key language features that you are already familiar with, such as Enums, Strings and Collections, are teased apart and examined under the twin microscopes of MSIL (Intermediate Language) and the Windbg debugger to see what's really going on behind the scenes as your code is compiled and passed to the CLR.\n\nTitle: Expert C # 5.0: with the .NET 4.5 Framework\nAuthor: Mohammad Rahman\nPublisher: Apress\nISBN: 1430248602\nYear: 2012\nFormat: PDF\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
