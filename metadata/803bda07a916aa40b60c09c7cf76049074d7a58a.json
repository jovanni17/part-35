In the midterm election year 2010, recession-battered Americans expressed their discontent with a simultaneously overreaching and underperforming government by turning the formerly Democratically controlled House over to the Republicans. Among the new GOP majority were eighty-seven freshmen, many of them political novices with Tea Party backing who pledged a more open, responsive, and fiscally thrifty House. What the 112th Congress instead achieved was a public standing so lowÃ¢â‚¬â€a ghastly 9 percent approval ratingÃ¢â‚¬â€ that, as its longest-serving member, John Dingell, would dryly remark, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think pedophiles would do better.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ What happened? Robert Draper explores this question just as he examined the Bush White House in his 2007 New York Times bestselling book Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. BushÃ¢â‚¬â€by burrowing deeply inside the subject, gaining cooperation of the major players, and producing a colorful, unsparingly detailed, but evenhanded narrative of how the House of Representatives became a house of ill repute.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published -  April 24th 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:803bda07a916aa40b60c09c7cf76049074d7a58a","amp;dn":"Do+Not+Ask+What+Good+We+Do+by+Robert+Draper+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"803bda07a916aa40b60c09c7cf76049074d7a58a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,59,218,7,169,22,170,64,182,12,9,199,207,118,4,144,116,215,165,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
