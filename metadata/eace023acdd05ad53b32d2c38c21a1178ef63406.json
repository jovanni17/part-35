Isnâ€™t it easier just to remember 1-2-3? Thatâ€™s the ratio of ingredients that always make a basic, delicious cookie dough: 1 part sugar, 2 parts fat, and 3 parts flour. From there, add anything you wantâ€”chocolate, lemon and orange zest, nuts, poppy seeds, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, almond extract, or peanut butter, to name a few favorite additions. Replace white sugar with brown for a darker, chewier cookie. Add baking powder and/or eggs for a lighter, airier texture.\r\n\r\nRatios are the starting point from which a thousand variations begin.\r\n\r\nRatios are the simple proportions of one ingredient to another. Biscuit dough is 3:1:2â€”or 3 parts flour, 1 part fat, and 2 parts liquid. This ratio is the beginning of many variations, and because the biscuit takes sweet and savory flavors with equal grace, you can top it with whipped cream and strawberries or sausage gravy. Vinaigrette is 3:1, or 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, and is one of the most useful sauces imaginable, giving everything from grilled meats and fish to steamed vegetables or lettuces intense flavor.\r\n\r\nCooking with ratios will unchain you from recipes and set you free. With thirty-three ratios and suggestions for enticing variations, Ratio is the truth of cooking: basic preparations that teach us how the fundamental ingredients of the kitchenâ€”water, flour, butter and oils, milk and cream, and eggsâ€”work. Change the ratio and bread dough becomes pasta dough, cakes become muffins become popovers become crepes.\r\n\r\nAs the culinary world fills up with overly complicated recipes and never-ending ingredient lists, Michael Ruhlman blasts through the surplus of information and delivers this innovative, straightforward book that cuts to the core of cooking. Ratio provides one of the greatest kitchen lessons there isâ€”and it makes the cooking easier and more satisfying than ever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eace023acdd05ad53b32d2c38c21a1178ef63406","amp;dn":"Ratio+%282009%29+%28Epub+and+Mobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eace023acdd05ad53b32d2c38c21a1178ef63406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,206,2,58,205,208,90,213,59,50,210,195,140,33,161,23,142,246,52,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
