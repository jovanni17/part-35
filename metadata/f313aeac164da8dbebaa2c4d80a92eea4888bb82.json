This album is the debut of King Crimson's third incarnation, and features original member and guitarist Robert Fripp and new members John Wetton (vocals, bass), David Cross (violin, mellotron), Jamie Muir (percussion), and Bill Bruford (drums), as well as lyricist Richard Palmer-James. The album sees the band incorporate into its sound violin and also various exotic percussion instruments, including sheet metal and mbiras. The title was invented by percussionist Jamie Muir and is meant to signify what he heard in this album's music: something fragile and delicate (larks' tongues) encased in something corrosive and acidic (aspic).\nThe album opens with a long experimental instrumental piece titled &quot;Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One.&quot; After that there are three vocal pieces, &quot;Book of Saturday&quot;, &quot;Exiles&quot; and &quot;Easy Money.&quot; These are followed by two more instrumentals, &quot;The Talking Drum&quot; and &quot;Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two.&quot; The instrumental pieces on this album have strong jazz fusion influences, and portions have an almost heavy metal feel. The angry, angular mood of this album is largely credited to the influence of BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.king-crimson.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.king-crimson.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f313aeac164da8dbebaa2c4d80a92eea4888bb82","amp;dn":"King+Crimson++-+Larks%5C%27+Tongues+In+Aspic++%281973%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f313aeac164da8dbebaa2c4d80a92eea4888bb82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,19,174,172,22,77,168,219,235,170,44,77,128,169,46,234,72,136,187,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
