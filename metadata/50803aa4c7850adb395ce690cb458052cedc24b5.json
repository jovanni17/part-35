It makes the info box say &quot;Pro&quot;, but if you use the Pro features (like for instance create bookmarks) and save, the document still gets watermarked.\n\nNote that this serial is good for all version 2.xxx AFAIK. There shouldn't be any need to install the program if you already have it installed. I've successfully used the serial on several versions that earlier had the EAT serial. So just take the serial and try it if you already have a version 2.xxx.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50803aa4c7850adb395ce690cb458052cedc24b5","amp;dn":"PDF-XChange+Viewer+Pro+2.054+%2B+serial-vokeon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50803aa4c7850adb395ce690cb458052cedc24b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,128,58,164,199,133,10,219,57,92,230,144,203,69,128,82,206,220,36,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
