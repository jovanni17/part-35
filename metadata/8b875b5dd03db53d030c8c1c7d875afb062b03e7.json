The album starts out with &quot;Summer of '69,&quot; the appealing autobiographical song about the 10-year-old Adams learning to play his first guitar in Ontario, and includes &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do for You,&quot; the synth-laced ballad that wound up in the Guinness Book of World Records after topping the British singles charts for 16 weeks. With its over-the-top, gravelly vocals, So Far So Good reminds one of Rod Stewart's 1980s work when he was coasting on past achievements. Unfortunately, Adams has never had a period like Stewart's glory years in the '70s. --Geoffrey Himes\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.elit-bg.com/torrentimg/d22437115bce750ea82624c7052f3d4394650554.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.elit-bg.com/torrentimg/d22437115bce750ea82624c7052f3d4394650554.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
