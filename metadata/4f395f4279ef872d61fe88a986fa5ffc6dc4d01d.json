They want to escape the poverty and hard labour of the city and travel south. Together with the girl Linda (who acts as the narrator in the movie) they find employment on a farm in the Panhandle, Texas. When the harvest is over the young, rich and handsome farmer invites them to stay because he has fallen in love with Abby. When Bill and Abby discover that the farmer is seriously ill and has only got a year left to live they decide that Abby will accept his wedding proposal in order to make some benefit out of the situation. When the expected death fails to come, jealousy and impatience are slowly setting in and accidents become eventually inevitable.\n\nIMDB-link......:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077405/\n\nDVD:  DVD-5\nVIDEO FORMAT: PAL 16:9\nCOLOR: Color (Metrocolor)\nLANGUAGE / SOUND MIX:\nSpanish / Dolby Digital 2.0\nItaliano / Dolby Digital 2.0\nFranÃƒÂ§ais / Dolby Digital 2.0\nEnglish / Dolby Digital 5.1\n\nSUBT: Spanish, English, Portuguese, FrancÃƒÂ©s, Italian, Croatian, Hebrew, Slovenian, Greek \n\nEXTRAS: \n\n \nDVDDecrypter.\nWithout Compression\nIt copies of the original","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f395f4279ef872d61fe88a986fa5ffc6dc4d01d","amp;dn":"Days+of+Heaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f395f4279ef872d61fe88a986fa5ffc6dc4d01d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,57,95,66,121,239,135,45,97,254,136,169,134,250,95,252,109,196,208,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
