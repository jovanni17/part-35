The techniques of financial econometrics facilitate the development and management of new financial instruments by providing models for pricing and risk assessment. In short, financial econometrics is an indispensable component to modern finance.\n\nThe Basics of Financial Econometrics covers the commonly used techniques in the field without using unnecessary mathematical/statistical analysis. It focuses on foundational ideas and how they are applied. Topics covered include: regression models, factor analysis, volatility estimations, and time series techniques. In addition, an associated website contains a number of real-world case studies related to important issues in this area.\n\nCovers the basics of financial econometricsÃ¢â‚¬â€an important topic in quantitative finance\nContains several chapters on topics typically not covered even in basic books on econometrics such as model selection, model risk, and mitigating model risk\nA companion website includes mini-cases that explain important topics in portfolio management, credit risk modeling, option pricing, and risk management\nGeared towards both practitioners and finance students who need to understand this dynamic discipline, but may not have advanced mathematical training, this book is a valuable resource on a topic of growing importance.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface xiii\nAcknowledgments xvii\n\nAbout the Authors xix\n\nChapter 1 Introduction 1\n\nFinancial Econometrics at Work 2\n\nThe Data Generating Process 5\n\nApplications of Financial Econometrics to Investment Management 6\n\nKey Points 10\n\nChapter 2 Simple Linear Regression 13\n\nThe Role of Correlation 13\n\nRegression Model: Linear Functional Relationship between Two Variables 14\n\nDistributional Assumptions of the Regression Model 16\n\nEstimating the Regression Model 18\n\nGoodness-of-Fit of the Model 22\n\nTwo Applications in Finance 25\n\nLinear Regression of a Nonlinear Relationship 36\n\nKey Points 38\n\nCHAPTER 3 Multiple Linear Regression 41\n\nThe Multiple Linear Regression Model 42\n\nAssumptions of the Multiple Linear Regression Model 43\n\nEstimation of the Model Parameters 43\n\nDesigning the Model 45\n\nDiagnostic Check and Model Significance 46\n\nApplications to Finance 51\n\nKey Points 79\n\nchapter 4 Building and Testing a Multiple Linear Regression Model 81\n\nThe Problem of Multicollinearity 81\n\nModel Building Techniques 84\n\nTesting the Assumptions of the Multiple Linear Regression Model 88\n\nKey Points 100\n\nCHAPTER 5 Introduction to Time Series Analysis 103\n\nWhat Is a Time Series?
