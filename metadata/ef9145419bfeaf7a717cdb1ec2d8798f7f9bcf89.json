You get what you negotiate.\n\nA business empire worth ten billion dollars. This is the tantalizing offer made by Vinay Mohan Acharya, one of IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s richest men, to Sapna Sinha, a simple salesgirl in an electronics store in downtown Delhi. She can be the next CEO of his incredibly huge and profitable company. There is only one catchÃ¢â‚¬â€she needs to pass seven tests from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“textbook of life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThus begins the most challenging journey Sapna has ever undertaken, one that will take her from her swanky showroom to the heat and dust of IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s backstreets and villages. Along the way she encounters a host of memorable personalities, from a vain Bollywood superstar to a kleptomaniac Gandhian. But are the seven tests real or is Acharya playing a game driven by a perverse fantasy?\n\nVikas Swarup, acclaimed author of Slumdog Millionaire and Six Suspects, has written a compelling, suspenseful tale about the lure of money and the power of dreams. The Accidental Apprentice is international crime fiction at its most entertaining.\n\n\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nA chance encounter results in an unbelievable offer for 23-year-old Sapna Sinha. Billionaire industrialist Vinay Mohan Acharya approaches saleswoman Sapna, the family breadwinner since her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s untimely death, as she leaves a temple in Delhi on her lunch hour, offering to make her CEO of his huge conglomerate if she can pass seven tests of character Ã¢â‚¬Å“from the textbook of life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Facing a family financial crisis, a suspicious Sapna reluctantly accepts the offer and soon displays leadership, integrity, courage, foresight, resourcefulness, and decisiveness, according to Acharya, in seemingly random situations, ranging from preventing an arranged marriage to breaking up a sweatshop employing children to acting to save her sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams and her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. But things go awry in the course of the last, most difficult test, leaving Sapna facing the death penalty and confirming that people are not always what they seem.
