More determined than ever, they are planning once again to get their hands on the famous magic potion. This time, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come with a stupid, evil plan: to invade the Gaul village and fight until one of them manages to grab GetafixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cauldron.\n\nHordes of legionaries emerge in succession across the battlefield from the Roman camps surrounding the village: Aquarium, Babaorum, Laudanum and Petibonum. Fortunately, Asterix, Obelix, Dogmatix and all the villageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inhabitants will be nearby to give you a hand in countering the attacks and defend the village.\n\nCollect the units of potion you need to place the Gauls and obstacles on the field. Each of them has their own skill. So, devise a good strategy for keeping the druidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potion in a safe place.... and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust the Romans!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Find all the main characters from the Asterix village \n- Use Gallic's gods special powers against Romans \n- Discover new ways to slap Romans thanks to awesome mini games \n- Play in story mode or endless mode\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bulkypix.asterix2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bulkypix.asterix2&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:409d4a4e4bbcd2df56ab7247a9e107c79feb19da","amp;dn":"Asterix%3A+Total+Retaliation+v1.4+%28Mod+%2B+Unmod%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"409d4a4e4bbcd2df56ab7247a9e107c79feb19da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,157,74,78,75,188,210,223,86,171,114,71,169,225,7,199,159,235,25,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
