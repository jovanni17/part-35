Edited by three leading social analysts, Automobilities presents one of the first and most wide-ranging examinations of the car and its promise of autonomy and mobility. Drawing on rich empirical detail, from ethnographies of office work on the motorway to the important of the car in French cultural theory, the contributions demonstrate just how significant have been the economic, technological, social and political consequences of a pervasive and accelerating culture of the car.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd70a369a464de0ff90ef24460d0b5b29c63333","amp;dn":"Automobilities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd70a369a464de0ff90ef24460d0b5b29c63333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,215,10,54,154,70,77,224,255,144,239,36,70,13,11,91,41,198,51,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
