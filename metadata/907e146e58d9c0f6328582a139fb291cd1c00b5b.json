For the first time ever, the palace of the peaks, Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, has opened its doors to the cameras for a whole year. It is a unique opportunity to take an in-depth glimpse of life upstairs and downstairs in the 21st century.\n\n\n3)  Part 3 \nSummer arrives, bringing with it wedding season at Chatsworth, but there is a veil hanging over proceedings and it does not belong to the bride. For the entire 2011 season, the famous south and west wings have been covered in scaffolding as part of a massive renovation; but it could spell disaster for their burgeoning wedding business and the all-important wedding photographs. However, ever-resourceful events manager Kay Rotchford has some Photoshop magic up her sleeve. And after a year of being hidden behind scaffolding, Chatsworth's 14 million pound renovation is finally revealed, and the great old house is ready to face the future. A passionate patron of the arts, the duke's taste is brought into question when the visitors take exception to his latest exhibit - a Damien Hirst sculpture of the flailed St Bartholomew currently residing in the Chapel..\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/2408/chatsworthscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img140.imageshack.us/img140/2408/chatsworthscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img860.imageshack.us/img860/626/chatsworthscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img860.imageshack.us/img860/626/chatsworthscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/5108/chatsworthscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/5108/chatsworthscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/3498/chatsworthscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/3498/chatsworthscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/843/chatsworthscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/843/chatsworthscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/1343/chatsworthscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/1343/chatsworthscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2234/chatsworthscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2234/chatsworthscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/1571/chatsworthscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/1571/chatsworthscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/4135/chatsworthscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/4135/chatsworthscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1642 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatsworth_House&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatsworth_House&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:907e146e58d9c0f6328582a139fb291cd1c00b5b","amp;dn":"BBC+Chatsworth+3of3+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"907e146e58d9c0f6328582a139fb291cd1c00b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,126,20,110,88,217,192,246,50,133,130,161,57,251,41,28,209,192,11,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
