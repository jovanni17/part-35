He no longer trusts translators after having encountered problems with his previous subtitled movies. \n\nGuillermo del Toro repeatedly said &quot;no&quot; to Hollywood producers, in spite of being offered double the budget provided the film was made in English. He didn't want any compromise in the storyline to suit the &quot;market needs&quot;. \n\nStephen King attended a screening of the film and sat next to Guillermo del Toro. According to Del Toro, King squirmed when the Pale Man chased Ofelia. Del Toro compared the experience of seeing King's reaction to winning an Oscar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nPans Labyrinth 2006 720p BRrip_sujaidr\n\n\n\nvideo details\n\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c28aaba5aa828ef6ecf2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 7 frames\nMuxing mode                      : Header stripping\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 870 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 688 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.860\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.041\n\nSOURCE 1080P\n\n\naudio details\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\n\n\n\n\n\nlanguage                         SPANISH\n\nsubs                             english MUXED\n\n\n\nSAMPLE                  :included\n\nthanks to sun\n\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nPLOT:In 1944 fascist Spain, a girl, fascinated with fairy-tales, is sent along with her pregnant mother to live with her new stepfather, a ruthless captain of the Spanish army. During the night, she meets a fairy who takes her to an old faun in the center of the labyrinth. He tells her she's a princess, but must prove her royalty by surviving three gruesome tasks. If she fails, she will never prove herself to be the the true princess and will never see her real father, the king, again.\n\n\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro\n\nStars:           Ivana Baquero, Ariadna Gil and Sergi LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez\nimdb:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/z1Dh8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/z1Dh8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/RueHG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/RueHG.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/iRcIR.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/iRcIR.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/4PJP2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/4PJP2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE THEN DO BUY THE ORIGINAL BLURAY/DVD\n\nTORRENT STAts\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/fa9a/1afae64fe.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/fa9a/1afae64fe.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8978bc268281c341491fa9ae2e70761a2ee5684","amp;dn":"Pans+Labyrinth+2006+720p+BRrip_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8978bc268281c341491fa9ae2e70761a2ee5684","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,151,139,194,104,40,28,52,20,145,250,154,226,231,7,97,162,238,86,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
