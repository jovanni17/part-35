The lesson plans enable students to understand the importance of environments where everyone feels welcomed, valued, and respected. Supplemented by creative illustrations and summarized tables of key information, the book will be helpful to community and school librarians, elementary school teachers, and paraprofessionals serving pre-K through 4th grade students. Additionally, school-based mental health professionals such as school counselors, psychologists, and social workers can utilize the book's resources to teach social skills in classrooms and group counseling sessions.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
