It is aimed at academic, hobbyist, and commercial developers and handles a wide variety of robot hardware.\n RDS is based on CCR (Concurrency and Coordination Runtime): a .NET-based concurrent library implementation for managing asynchronous parallel tasks. This technique involves using message-passing and a lightweight services-oriented runtime, DSS (Decentralized Software Services), which allows the orchestration of multiple services to achieve complex behaviors.\n Features include: a visual programming tool, Microsoft Visual Programming Language for creating and debugging robot applications, web-based and windows-based interfaces, 3D simulation (including hardware acceleration), easy access to a robot's sensors and actuators. The primary programming language is C#.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c5d2a96bd2176fe343bbbd715bd3d7ecd6e811","amp;dn":"Robotics+Developer+Studio+2008+R3+%28x86+and+x64%29+-+%28English%29+-+Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c5d2a96bd2176fe343bbbd715bd3d7ecd6e811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,197,210,169,107,210,23,111,227,67,187,189,113,91,211,215,236,214,232,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
