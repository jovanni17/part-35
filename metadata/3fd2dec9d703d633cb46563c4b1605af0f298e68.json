Lifetime (2:26)\n\nRyan Francesconi has long been a favorite here at Opus, due the delicate and intricately detailed electronica that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s released under the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRFÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ moniker. However, his latest releaseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a collaboration with The Year ZeroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Lili De La MoraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½finds Francesconi removing virtually all electronic elements from his music. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nary a hint of glitch, glurp, or digital processing to be found on any of the tracks on Eleven Continents.\n\nBut thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about all thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s changed. FrancesconiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acute attention to detail is still very much in effect. And even though itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a largely acoustic album, and largely removed from FrancesconiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s usual sound palette, the overall tone of Eleven Continents is very similar to that of Interno or Falls. Francesconi is still as instrospective and elegiac as ever, perhaps even moreso. And even though the music is, technically, more stripped down than FrancesconiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s usual output, one would never mistake it for being bleak or barren.\n\nIn addition to FrancesconiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deftly picked guitar and De La MoraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s breathy voice, wisps of cello, trumpet, flute, and harp drift through the album gentle as a breeze, never upsetting its delicate balance. As is always the case with Francesconi, the arrangements possess both an assuredness and a sense of restraint; each instrument is present only to the extent to which itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s needed for the most aesthetic impact, and once through, is softly and quietly retired. The result is music that moves efficiently without sounding hollow and artificial, music that is full of embellishment while sounding neither gaudy nor ostentatious.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThrough The TreesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ develops into a fully fleshed-out piece, replete with shimmering guitars and brushed percussion, without the listener ever being aware of the build-up until theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re hit with the full, lovely weight. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is highlighted by quick, playful little ripples of acoustic guitar that gust over the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surface like leaves rustling in a storm; meanwhile, Darius Gottlieb cello provides a slightly more reserved counterpoint in the background.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHundreds Of ThreadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ moves with the meditative grace of a Zen ceremony, the plucked guitar notes silver as bells. Exotic dulcimer and sitar-like sounds seem to rise off of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCherry ParkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s service like clouds of incense, their intangible nature a perfect balance to the sharp, clear tones of the trumpet that eventually come ringing forth. And the piping flutes and slightly more up-tempo rhythms of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFascinatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recall Eric Matthews at his finest.\n\nThe albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest moments, though, come when the silvery tones of Joanna NewsomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harp join the mix. The albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s title track unfurls to reveal a rushing, ever-growing spiral of graceful guitars, playful harp strings, and fragile, pensive vocals. Every note sounds as if it has been bathed in silvery twilight, and, at the risk of sounding all psych-folk-y, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s difficult not to picture ethereal creatures caught up in a slow, stately waltz in some forgotten sylvan glade. So spellbinding is the song that its abrupt ending is jarring in an almost physical manner.\n\nLately, Lincoln has been surrounded by rainclouds on a daily basisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if you didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know better, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d swear the entire city had been transplanted to somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. Deep down inside, we know itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spring, that the warmth is soon to return. Meanwhile, the skies are still grey as slate and a chilly wind makes its way through the buildings.\n\nThe contrast is so sharp, the mixture of the seasonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the chill of winter with the green of springÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½quite evocative. Eleven Continents is a perfect soundtrack for days such as these, the melancholy arrangements meshing quite nicely with the forlorn skies even as the gentle and soothing vocals point the way towards brighterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and warmerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½days.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nPLEASE SEED\n\n\n[url] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fd2dec9d703d633cb46563c4b1605af0f298e68","amp;dn":"RF+%26amp%3B+Lili+De+La+Mora...Eleven+Continents%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fd2dec9d703d633cb46563c4b1605af0f298e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,210,222,201,215,3,214,51,203,70,86,60,75,22,5,175,15,41,142,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
