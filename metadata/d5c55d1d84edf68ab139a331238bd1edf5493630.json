It was StewartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 12th studio album and was released on Warner Bros. Records (WEA 92-3877-1). The tracks were recorded and mixed at The Record Plant, Los Angeles. It produced three singles, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby JaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What Am I Gonna Do (I'm So in Love With You)&quot;, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet SurrenderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nThe cover is a parody of Elvis Presley's 1959 album 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong.\nBody Wishes has received poor reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 1.5 out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;one of Rod Stewart's worst efforts.&quot; In the same review, &quot;Baby Jane&quot; and &quot;What Am I Gonna Do (I'm So in Love With You)&quot; are described as &quot;first-rate, synth-laden pop/rock filler&quot; that sound &quot;substantial&quot; in comparison to the other songs on the album. The album has sold more than 9 million copies, worldwide.\nSimilarly, Rolling Stone magazine, at the time of its release, gave it 2 out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;his latest and surely one of his least&quot;, although they did praise the opening song, &quot;Dancing Alone&quot;, calling it &quot;a Chuck Berry-styled Rock &amp; Roller that is both lively and witty&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\nA1 Dancin' Alone 3:59\nA2 Baby Jane 4:42\nA3 Move Me 3:35\nA4 Body Wishes 4:40\nA5 Sweet Surrender 4:00\nB1 What Am I Gonna Do (I'm So In Love With You) 4:18\nB2 Ghetto Blaster 4:07\nB3 Ready Now 3:34\nB4 Strangers Again 4:09\nB5 Satisfied 4:07\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nStyles: pop, blues rock, blue-eyed soul, folk rock, hard rock, soft rock\n\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : Vinyl\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~5000 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 192 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5c55d1d84edf68ab139a331238bd1edf5493630","amp;dn":"%281983%29+Rod+Stewart+-+Body+Wishes+%5BVinylRip+24-192%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5c55d1d84edf68ab139a331238bd1edf5493630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,197,93,29,132,237,246,138,177,57,163,49,35,139,209,237,245,73,54,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
