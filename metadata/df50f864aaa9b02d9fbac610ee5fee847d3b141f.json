These acclaimed dregs-of-society farces skewer the multinational, mega-merging, corporate forces that control our lives. Tom Hart's popular vagrant/rebel, Hutch Owen, rages while the world around him builds, merges, attends marketing seminars and goes IPO. The streets and alleyways that are his bedroom and study are now invisible beneath a coat of crude and insulting ads. His may be the only dissenting voice left! When the first tale, &quot;Hutch Owen's Working Hard,&quot; was released in 1994, it created an underground sensation and gained Tom Hart a die-hard following. Here are the two previously published tales, with two brand new, full-length stories, never before seen. Feel the Power! Catch the Wave! Join the Splurge!\n\n\n'Hutch Owen Vol 2: Unmarketable!'\n\nTop Shelf Productions, 2004, 196 pages\n\nThis graphic novel collects the all-new travels and travails of Hutch Owen, the outrageous homeless rebel that battles the corporate forces that control our lives.

Don't miss this politically astute and heart-warming farce.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df50f864aaa9b02d9fbac610ee5fee847d3b141f","amp;dn":"Tom+Hart+-+Hutch+Owen+Vol+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df50f864aaa9b02d9fbac610ee5fee847d3b141f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,80,248,100,170,169,176,45,159,186,198,16,238,95,238,132,125,59,20,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
