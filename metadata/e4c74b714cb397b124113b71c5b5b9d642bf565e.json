Understanding the elements of the 2D environment will provide a solid foundation in game creation, whether you stick with 2D or move on. FUNDAMENTAL 2D GAME PROGRAMMING WITH JAVA teaches you the basics using Java, including application programming, full-screen games, input handling, matrix transformations, basic physics, intersection testing, collision detection, and much more. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three parts cover: The Foundations (building a simple prototype game), the Polish (fine-tuning to create a satisfying gaming experience), and The Complete Game (creating an entire game from start to finish). Author and game developer Timothy Wright shares his toolkit of code and expertise to help you speed up the process of game programming in Java. Sharpen your Java skills and have a great time creating games with FUNDAMENTAL 2D GAME PROGRAMMING WITH JAVA.\n\nFeatures\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Approaches game programming from the indie developer point of view, instead of the usual AAA 3D programming view.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Three sections cover foundation issues, polishing, and completing your games.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Walks users throughout the process of creating a complete game from scratch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4c74b714cb397b124113b71c5b5b9d642bf565e","amp;dn":"Fundamental+2D+Game+Programming+with+Java+-+Timothy+Wright","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4c74b714cb397b124113b71c5b5b9d642bf565e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,199,75,113,76,179,151,177,36,17,59,113,197,181,185,214,66,191,86,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
