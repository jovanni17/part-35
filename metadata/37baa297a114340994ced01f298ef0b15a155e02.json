Now theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re desirable vantage points. This map provides the ideal environment for close-range conflict between small teams. Hold the high ground to rain gunfire down on enemies. But one misstep can lead to a quick trip to the planetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surface.\n- Aquarius Beach: This facility once housed hundreds of N.O.V.A. trainees. Now, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a mid-range killing field with prime sniper nests and plenty of natural cover. But donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get comfortable in one spot; many paths make it easy to flank the unaware. The ability to adapt to interior and exterior combat is key to survival here.\n- Icy Bridge: This vast Volterite mining complex uses an energy field to stay suspended between mountains. While you can walk on this field, it does not obstruct weapons. It's great for getting the drop on unsuspecting targets, but provides no cover from counterattacks. Large teams often vie for control of the strategic center facility.\n\nGet 10 free XP levels in multiplayer.\n\nBetter protection against hacking thanks to bug fixes.\n\nPlease share....Dont hit and run...SEEEED it back at least once.\n\nOf course, if you want to seed it back more than once, that would be ok too :)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37baa297a114340994ced01f298ef0b15a155e02","amp;dn":"NOVA.2.Near.Orbit.Vanguard.Alliance-v1.1.7-most_uniQue.ipa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37baa297a114340994ced01f298ef0b15a155e02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,186,162,151,161,20,52,9,148,206,208,31,41,142,240,177,90,21,94,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
