While it might look benign, the Thames is actually one of the most dangerous stretches of water in the UK and the volunteers are called from their beds in the middle of the night to try and rescue two students who have jumped naked into the river while high on LSD. \r\n\r\nAt the coast in Newquay the volunteers and coastguard helicopter are scrambled to try and help a 12 year-old boy on a cub scout â€˜coasteeringâ€™ trip, who has fallen badly and has suspected spinal damage.\r\n\r\nEastbourne lifeboat station covers a stretch of coastline which includes Beachy Head, so have had to become more familiar with death than most. Recovering the body of someone who has taken their own life is a task that no-one relishes but also a duty the volunteers see as an important service to the family who have lost a loved one - and an opportunity to reflect on what truly matters in their own lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4907ed02d6ca55889d2657067f6d1968492805f","amp;dn":"Saving.Lives.at.Sea.s01e02.EN.SUB.MPEG4.x264.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4907ed02d6ca55889d2657067f6d1968492805f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,144,126,208,45,108,165,88,137,210,101,112,103,246,209,150,132,146,128,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
