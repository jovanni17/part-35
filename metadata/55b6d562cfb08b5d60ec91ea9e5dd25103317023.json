Freedom can be\nstolen from you at any time. Be prepared. Find out how every citizen can maximize his own freedom while\nminimizing the risks by being a secret freedom fighter.\nA totalitarian state is what we might get after the collapse of society, economic disaster or natural\ncataclysm. And then we&amp;#039;ll have to fight for our freedom as well as for survival. If you want to be a secret\nfreedom fighter, you won&amp;#039;t join any protest groups, stand on street corners making speeches, or run with a\nmob that throws rocks at cops. The secret freedom fighter must fight alone.\nThe secret freedom fighter has to be the invisible man, always working in secret. Because he is one\nman working alone, he doesn&amp;#039;t have to do as much damage in a single operation as a guerrilla force would to\njustify the risk. And he doesn&amp;#039;t have to worry that someone will betray him and turn him in to the authorities.\nWith years of experience in governmental, religious and freelance assignments around the world, the\nauthor has learned how unfree governments work and where they are most vulnerable to attack by an\nindividual acting on his own. He tells which targets are fair game--and which aren&amp;#039;t--choosing weapons and\nmethods, lethal and non lethal tactics, working within your own limitations to wreak havoc on morale and\ngovernment operations, and much more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55b6d562cfb08b5d60ec91ea9e5dd25103317023","amp;dn":"TO+BREAK+A+TYRANTS+CHAINS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55b6d562cfb08b5d60ec91ea9e5dd25103317023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,182,213,98,207,176,139,93,96,236,145,234,158,93,210,81,3,49,112,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
