Not a book for someone looking for a vitamin approach or novel weight loss technique. This is simply a long and complex, but at times amusing, review of energy expenditure in the human. The physics are Newtonian--no magic weight loss here! After you read this book one learns a great party trick--approach someone and tell them to if you knew how much oxygen they use, how much cardon dioxide they blow off, and how much nitrogen is in their urine you could tell then what percentage of calories thay are buring from fat, protein, and carbohydrates!\nI use this book to prep first year medical student lectures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d15b1be08a5671682e3ab8cb3465519dd2244092","amp;dn":"Energy+Metabolism%2C+Indirect+Calorimetry%2C+and+Nutrition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d15b1be08a5671682e3ab8cb3465519dd2244092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,91,27,224,138,86,113,104,46,58,184,203,52,101,81,157,210,36,64,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
