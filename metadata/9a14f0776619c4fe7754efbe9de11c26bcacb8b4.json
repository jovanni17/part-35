If you have installed a different HD; done a Clean Install and want to go back; if you have lost the function of the Lenovo One Key Recovery, this is for you! The discs will install Windows 8 64bit, I can only guarantee it will work for the 2099-8NU model, but it also should work for other Win 8 native Y580s (You can check the models at the 'Y580 Data Sheet.pdf'), I wouldn't try on a Win 7 though.\n\nHappy Sharing!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a14f0776619c4fe7754efbe9de11c26bcacb8b4","amp;dn":"Lenovo+Y580+Recovery+Discs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a14f0776619c4fe7754efbe9de11c26bcacb8b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,20,240,119,102,25,196,254,119,84,239,190,157,225,28,38,188,172,184,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
