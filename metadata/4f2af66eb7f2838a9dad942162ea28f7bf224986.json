But he remained an active attraction on the Chicago circuit, following in his sibling's footsteps and patiently waiting for his own star to rise up until his death. Like his sibling, Phil Guy played with harpist Raful Neal (for a decade) before leaving the Baton Rouge scene for Chicago in 1969. There he played with his brother's high-energy organization as well as behind harpist Junior Wells (Phil handled guitar duties with Sammy Lawhorn on Wells' underrated mid-'70s Delmark album On Tap). Phil Guy cut albums of his own for JSP; they were generally lacking in originality if not spirit. Phil Guy lost his battle with liver and kidney cancer in August of 2008. ~ Bill Dahl\n\nRecording information: Soto Sound, Chicago, IL (1985-1986);\nStrawberry Studio, Stockport, England (1985-1986).[Tracks 9-12]\n\nPhil Guy (vocals, guitar); \nAnthony Palmer, Norman Beaker (guitar); \nDave Bainbridge (keyboards); \nTim Franks (drums).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f2af66eb7f2838a9dad942162ea28f7bf224986","amp;dn":"Phil+Guy+Its+a+Real+Mutha%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f2af66eb7f2838a9dad942162ea28f7bf224986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,42,246,110,183,242,131,138,157,173,148,33,98,234,40,247,191,34,73,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
