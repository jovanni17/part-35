They changed their name to The Gandharvas in 1993, after Gandharvas, who are musical spirits in Hinduism.[2]\n\nIn November 1993 they signed with the label Watch Music, and in 1994 released their debut album as The Gandharvas, titled A Soap Bubble and Inertia. The album included the single &quot;The First Day of Spring&quot;, which was named Song of the Year (CASBY Award) by The Edge 102.1 in Toronto, and was nominated for MuchMusic's Video of the Year.[2] In 1995, they released their sophomore album Kicking in the Water, an shortly after were signed by major label MCA Records. Their 1997 release, Sold for a Smile, included the singles &quot;Downtime&quot; and &quot;Watching the Girl.&quot; All three albums were also released in Japan on the label Avex DD.\n\nThough Sold for a Smile was a minor commercial success (with the &quot;Downtime&quot; video receiving substantial play at MuchMusic), the album would be the band's last, as the grunge/alternative movement of the 1990s faded in popularity. They would announce their breakup in 2000.\n\nFollowing the break-up of the band, Beau Cook returned to his former band, Smoother. Eric Howden is now the singer-songwriter for the Canadian band Raised by Swans. Vocalist Paul Jago became a geologist and moved to Arizona, later forming the band SAID DOG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Soap Bubble &amp; Inertia 1994\n\n\nA Soap Bubble and Inertia is the debut album by Canadian alternative rock band The Gandharvas. It was released in 1994 on the Thermometer Sound Surface record label.\n\nThe album's title is taken from a line in the novel &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The album's single, &quot;The First Day of Spring,&quot; was named Song of the Year for 1994 (CASBY Award) by The Edge 102.1 in Toronto, Ontario. In 2007 the same radio station ranked the song #14 in their &quot;Top 102 Canadian New Rock Songs of All Time&quot; list.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;The First Day of Spring&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n2.\t&quot;Saturn Quits Fasting&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n3.\t&quot;The Coffee Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n4.\t&quot;Bundle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n5.\t&quot;Beakfuls of Heroin&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n6.\t&quot;Shadow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n7.\t&quot;The Supreme Personality&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n8.\t&quot;Dallying&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n9.\t&quot;Cans&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n10.\t&quot;Soap Bubble Meets Inertia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:02\n11.\t&quot;Elevator Bugs&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n12.\t&quot;Circus Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKicking in the Water 1995\n\n\nKicking in the Water is the second album by Canadian band The Gandharvas.
