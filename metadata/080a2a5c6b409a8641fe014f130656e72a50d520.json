Better yet, do you like women singing showtunes? Or, even better yet, do you like DIVAS singing showtunes? This televised concert manages to string together a fantastic cast of fantastic women singing fantastic songs. While the &quot;Lloyd Webber Love Trio&quot; is trite and could have been left out, there is a plethora of excellent material here, much of it under-performed. Highlights include Karen Ziemba&amp;#039;s &quot;I Wanna Be a Rockette,&quot; complete with the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes right behind her, Audra McDonald&amp;#039;s hilarious turn with &quot;Down With Love,&quot; and Liza Minnelli singing the [expletive deleted] out of &quot;Some People.&quot;\n\nI can see that some of you are still shaking your heads -- but this show has not one, not two, but three &quot;must-see&quot; performances that absolutely stopped the show cold. The first is Linda Eder (&quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot;) brilliantly singing &quot;Man of La Mancha.&quot; The second appears shortly thereafter -- Jennifer Holliday&amp;#039;s heartbreaking ballad &quot;And I Am Telling You I&amp;#039;m Not Going.&quot; But the third, the concert&amp;#039;s last solo, is Elaine Stritch singing Stephen Sondheim&amp;#039;s witty (and bitchy!) diatribe against &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch.&quot; This great actress, singing this great song, is alone worth the purchase price of this concert.&quot; \n\nCast (in alphabetical order) \n\nJulie Andrews ...
