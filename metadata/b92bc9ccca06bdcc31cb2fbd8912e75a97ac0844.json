The Jayhawks (often referred to by fans as The Bunkhouse album) was originally released in 1986 on Bunkhouse Records, with a pressing of only 2000 vinyl copies. Fans not fortunate enough to own a copy of The Jayhawks will be happy to know that it is finally available on CD, and again on vinyl for the first time in nearly 25 years. \n\n\n\nThe Jayhawks reissue includes an eight-page booklet with new photos from the recording period and a new essay by Jayhawks co-founder Mark Olson about album producer and then band manager Charlie Pine. The tracks are the original thirteen songs that appeared on the album, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFalling StarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which recently resurfaced on Music From The North Country: The Jayhawks Anthology (American Recordings/Legacy Recordings) in 2009.\n\n\nThe 1986 incarnation of The Jayhawks featured Mark Olson (vocals/guitar), Gary Louris (lead guitar/vocals), Marc Perlman (bass) and Norm Rogers (drums). After listening to The Jayhawks, it is clear why the band became a catalyst in the evolution of what would eventually be coined alt-country. The album has more in common with Gram Parsons and The Flying Burrito Brothers than it does with later Jayhawks classics Tomorrow The Green Grass and Hollywood Town Hall. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite evident where those milestone albums grew out of.\n\n1.  Falling Star\n2.  Tried And True\n3.  Let The Critics Wonder\n4.
