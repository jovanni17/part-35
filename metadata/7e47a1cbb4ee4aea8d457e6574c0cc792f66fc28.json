Original size is 1.10GB and I could't compress it anymore using 7zip. But I assure you guys, it's a lot better in the quality than every other MOD!\r\n\r\nInstallation : Extract from .7z into a random folder. Run the game in Admin Mode from the .exe. If you want to unlock all cards here's the tutorial :\r\n \nhttp://www.1337x.to/torrent/1304562/Yu-Gi-Oh-How-To-Unlock-All-Cards/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e47a1cbb4ee4aea8d457e6574c0cc792f66fc28","amp;dn":"Yu-Gi-Oh%21+5D%27s+Power+of+Chaos+Akiza+the+Black+Rose+%28MOD%29%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e47a1cbb4ee4aea8d457e6574c0cc792f66fc28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,71,161,203,180,238,74,234,141,69,126,101,116,192,204,121,47,102,252,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
