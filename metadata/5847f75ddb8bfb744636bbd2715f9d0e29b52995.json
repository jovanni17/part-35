The ultimate verification of theoretical models and reliable equations for portraying basic properties for such systems seems to be possible only when including temperature and pressure paths. This volume presents a set of papers related to novel findings on the glass transition phenomenon, phase transitions in liquid crystals, critical mixtures, bioliquids, geophysical system which can reveal surprising &quot;secret&quot; features only when using extreme pressures. This can be illustrated by the link between colloidal and molecular glassformers, the universal onset of the non-trivial dynamics in glasses, demistification of the secondary relaxation or novel findings associated with liquid - liquid near critical transitions in critical mixture, liquid crystals and in one component liquid, including water Particularly noteworthy is the emerging possibility of applications in geophysical and environment- relevant system as well as in technological application from material engineering, pharmacy industry, to biotechnology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5847f75ddb8bfb744636bbd2715f9d0e29b52995","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Metastable+Systems+under+Pressure+%28NATO+Science+for","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5847f75ddb8bfb744636bbd2715f9d0e29b52995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,71,247,93,219,139,251,116,70,54,187,210,113,95,157,14,41,181,41,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
