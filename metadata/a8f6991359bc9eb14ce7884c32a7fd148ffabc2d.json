Point Blank was a two-issue black and white magazine co-published by Eclipse with John Brown/Acme Press. It's tagline was 'the Best of European Strip Art'. Several ongoing stories run in each issue and it was apparently expected to be a regularly-published mag, based on the previews and subscription forms. Interestingly, these copies seem to be from Britain, as the primary price on the cover is in Pounds; the advertisements support this theory. I do not recognize any of the creators' names but the linework is very nice, with some of it reminding me of Jordi Bernet of 'Torpedo' fame.\n\nWithin are both issues. Creative teams - thanks! Scanners - ditto! Euroget it, Euroseed it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8f6991359bc9eb14ce7884c32a7fd148ffabc2d","amp;dn":"Pont+Blank+%28Eclipse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8f6991359bc9eb14ce7884c32a7fd148ffabc2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,246,153,19,89,188,158,177,76,231,136,76,50,167,253,20,143,250,188,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
