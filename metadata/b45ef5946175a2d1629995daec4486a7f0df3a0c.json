Staked-out in his one-bedroom apartment with his kidnap victim, Brian, Gigli soon realizes that what he thought would be a routine assignment soon becomes a tumultuous task. Ricki, a gorgeous, free-spirited female gangster is sent to assist Gigli with the kidnapping because his boss does not think that Gigli is up to the job. But when his feelings for the decidedly unavailable Ricki begin to grow, and he actually becomes concerned for Brian, tough guy Gigli begins to transform into an actual human being...which considering his profession could be a very dangerous occupation.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299930/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299930/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/media/rm2428213504/tt0299930?slideshow=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/media/rm2428213504/tt0299930?slideshow=1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast\nBen Affleck, Terry Camilleri, David Backus, Lenny Venito, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bartha\n\nFeel free if you would like to comment to this torrent.
