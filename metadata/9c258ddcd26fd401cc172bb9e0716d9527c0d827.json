Chapter 1 of the World Drug Report 2014 provides a global overview of the latest developments with respect to opiates, cocaine, cannabis and amphetamines (including Ã¢â‚¬Å“ecstasyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and the health impact of drug use. Chapter 2 zeroes in on the control of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs.\n\nOn the basis of comprehensive information on supply, as well as the relatively limited new information on demand, it can be concluded that overall the global situation with regard to the prevalence of illicit drug use and problem drug use1 is generally stable, with the total global number of drug users increasingly commensurate with the growth of the world population.\n\nThat said, each region exhibits its own peculiarities with respect to specific drugs. Polydrug use, which is generally understood as the use of two or more substances at the same time or sequentially, remains a major concern, both from a public health and a drug control perspective.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c258ddcd26fd401cc172bb9e0716d9527c0d827","amp;dn":"UNODC+World+Drug+Report+2014+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c258ddcd26fd401cc172bb9e0716d9527c0d827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,37,141,220,210,111,212,1,204,23,43,185,224,113,109,149,39,192,216,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
