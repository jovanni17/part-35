He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals &quot;escape&quot; in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity. \n\n\n\nShutter Island Cam Xvid-Classified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8767d3d06bf3a5fb68a59d66ba8a0d7316ea326","amp;dn":"Shutter+Island+%282010%2C+Cam.Xvid%29+-+Leonardo+DiCaprio%2C+Scorsese","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8767d3d06bf3a5fb68a59d66ba8a0d7316ea326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,118,125,61,6,191,58,95,182,138,89,214,107,168,160,215,49,110,163,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
