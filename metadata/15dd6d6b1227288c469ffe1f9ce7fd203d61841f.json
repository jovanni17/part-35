Indeed, in War and Peace, it is above all, the exhausted truthfulness in his character that is most striking, revealing a sincerity which seems to fear nothing in exploring the most profound and inexorable philosophical ideas.\n\nIndeed, it is in this context that TolstoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enigmatic remark, namely that War and Peace is &quot;not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less an historical chronicle&quot; can be understood. For War and Peace certainly is a truly great novel, is an undeniably powerful poem and is a historical chronicle of epic proportions. But underneath the unforgettable scenes of destruction and the beautiful passage on love is a metaphysical treatise on the very nature of Man and his relationship to God.\nThis collection brings together, for the first time in one volume, TolstoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War and Peace with the definitive preface on TolstoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lasting literary legacy.\n\nThe masterful translation, which was personally approved by Tolstoy himself, is by Louise and Aylmer Maude.\n\nSPECIAL KINDLE ENABLED FEATURES:\n\nThis edition has special Kindle enabled features, including interactive table of contents, text-to-speech capabilities which enable audiobook features, as well as words that can be looked up on the Kindle supplied built in dictionary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15dd6d6b1227288c469ffe1f9ce7fd203d61841f","amp;dn":"War+and+Peace+%28Cambridge+World+Classics%29+Critical+Edition+%28Annot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15dd6d6b1227288c469ffe1f9ce7fd203d61841f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,221,109,107,18,39,40,140,70,159,254,31,156,231,253,32,61,97,132,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
