Hypnotically, it will transport you through many different aspects of your own mind. The Sphinx of Imagination teaches an unusual story of creation, one that takes place between the Real and the Fantasy. This 60-minute metaphoric masterpiece is noted as one of the most complex and interesting stories ever told. It took over six years to design and develop. The Sphinx was created by Hypnotica and musically scored and sound designed by Denver Clay.\n\nListeners will have varied experiences with the Sphinx of Imagination: some will not remember anything at all; others will find their consciousness awakened on a profound level. The result of your own voyage will be a new framework for your development as an individual.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a57a9c09d14bac8ba826e25f8c8d1b295f68696","amp;dn":"hypnotica-sphinx+of+the+imagination","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a57a9c09d14bac8ba826e25f8c8d1b295f68696","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,87,169,192,157,20,186,200,186,130,110,37,248,200,209,178,149,246,134,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
