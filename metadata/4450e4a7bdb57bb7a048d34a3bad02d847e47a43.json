Three of the songs on Eldorado turned up on that record (including &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Cry&quot; in a different version), but &quot;Cocaine Eyes&quot; and &quot;Heavy Love&quot; did not, making this disc a necessary purchase for Young completists.\n\nFans of the Freedom album should seek this out the version of &amp;#039;Dont cry&amp;#039; is a quite different to the version on Freedom. The other songs from Freedom, &amp;#039;Eldorado&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;On broadway&amp;#039; also have some subtle diofferences as well. You also get the gutar riot that is cocaine eyes (a tribute to Steven Stills ?) and &amp;#039;Heavy love&amp;#039;.\nNeil Young at his uncompromising best, the Axe murderer\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n   1. &quot;Cocaine Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n   2. &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Cry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n   3. &quot;Heavy Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n   4. &quot;On Broadway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n   5. &quot;Eldorado&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n\n\nNeil Young: guitar, vocal\nChad Cromwell: drums\nRick &quot;The Bass Player&quot; Rosas: bass\n\nRecorded at The Hit Factory, New York City, Dec. 13-15, 1988\nProduced by &quot;The Volume Dealers&quot; (Neil Young &amp; Niko Bolas)\nReleased in Apr. 21, 1989\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4450e4a7bdb57bb7a048d34a3bad02d847e47a43","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+%26+The+Restless-Eldorado%28EP%29%281989%29%5BEAC-FLAC%5D%5BTWR6%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4450e4a7bdb57bb7a048d34a3bad02d847e47a43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,80,228,167,189,181,123,183,160,72,211,74,59,173,2,216,71,228,122,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
