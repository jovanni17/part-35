Kennedy was shot and killed while traveling down Elm Street, Dallas, Texas, in an open car in a motorcade. Everyone agrees about that. Many people think that agencies of the U.S. Government have lied about or covered up details of the assassination. For three decades, people thought the best proof of foul play was a 27-second home movie of the assassination taken by a Dallas dressmaker, Abraham Zapruder. It shows JFKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s head being blasted backwards and to his left. This seems to tell us that the shooter was in front of the car on the right side, on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgrassy knollÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (small hill) next to Elm Street. But the U.S. Government insisted that JFK was shot by just one man hiding in a building far behind the limousine. Things get more complicated when we look at the film frame-by-frame. As the bullet hits, JFKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s head first moves forwards.\n\nIn the 1990s, researchers started to realize that there was a fourth possible explanation. ZapruderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film might also be a part of the lies and cover-up that agencies of the U.S. Government had weaved around the JFK assassination! Scientists examined the Zapruder film. They found that, while most of it looks completely genuine, some of the images are impossible. They violate the laws of physics. They could not have come from ZapruderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home movie camera. ZapruderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film is a very good forgery. It is almost perfect. Some mistakes took almost 40 years to find. The scientists also proved that ZapruderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film was not just changed a little bit. The whole film is a fake!\n\nFiles: see file list","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ffaae66240308035df275ba83ab0da64b30a66a","amp;dn":"JFK+Assassination+Film+Hoax+%5Bstudy+pack%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ffaae66240308035df275ba83ab0da64b30a66a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,250,174,102,36,3,8,3,93,242,117,186,131,171,13,166,75,48,166,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
