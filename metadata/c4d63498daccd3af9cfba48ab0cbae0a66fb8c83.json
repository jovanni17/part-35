You can easily play back such files with programs like VLC Media Player.\n\nIf you know what you're doing you can use stand alone codecs as well.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nOh, and Barrysoreteo\n\nI call Rule 34 on the game...therefore I win\n\n(The 'Instant Rule 34 Template' is something I do not accept either!)\n\n\nPlus...how did you get that IP?
