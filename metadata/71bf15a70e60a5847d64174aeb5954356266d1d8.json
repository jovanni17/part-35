Join the slow-moving, slow-talking, but oddly quick-witted Roz, the slug-like Dispatch Manager at Monsters, Inc., for a challenging game of tag. You're it!\nMonsters, Inc. Wreck Room Arcade: Monster Tag takes you to the Wreck Room, the monsters' after-work hangout, for a not-so-typical game of tag. Join the temperamental Roz as a member of the CDA (Child Detection Agency) and tag as many human items as you can while delicately balanced on a seesaw.\n\nDisney/Pixar's Monsters, Inc. Wreck Room Arcade: Monster Tag is part of a trio of Monsters, Inc. Wreck Room Arcade games. Collect all three to unlock a secret fourth game, Monster Mania, free! Scare up as many screams as you can in Monster Mania, jumping through windows and doors to collect screams, all the while avoiding humans and the objects they're throwing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71bf15a70e60a5847d64174aeb5954356266d1d8","amp;dn":"Monsters%2C+Inc.+Wreck+Room+Arcade%3A+Monster+Tag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71bf15a70e60a5847d64174aeb5954356266d1d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,191,21,167,14,96,165,132,125,100,23,74,235,89,84,53,98,102,209,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
