She is nominated for &quot;Best Female Video,&quot; &quot;Best Editing,&quot; &quot;Best Pop Video&quot; and &quot;Best Song of the Summer.&quot; \n\nShould be nominated for &quot;Video of the Year,&quot; since her latest single, &quot;We Can't Stop,&quot; is like only the most watched, has to be seen to be believed, music video of all time. But MTV has no balls. Whereas Miley has mirror balls and will be wearing them on her sleeve when she performs at the VMAs for her very first time ever. \n\n&quot;Breakout/ Let the party start!&quot; But first -- and oh yes I have a thirst for firsts -- shall we go back? It's the Teen Choice Awards -- yes, where Miley would go on to win Song of the Summer for 2013 -- but 'the time of our lives' is now 2009, and the world debut of &quot;Party in the U.S.A.&quot;\n\n___________\n\nMiley Cyrus\n&quot;Party In The U.S.A.&quot;\nSunday, 2009-08-09\nTeen Choice Awards\nGibson Amphitheatre\nUniversal City, CA US\nFox TV\n\nMPG\nFormat: MPEG-PS\nOverall bitrate: 15.3 Mbps\nVideo: MPEG-2, 1280x720 (16:9), 59.940 fps, progressive, bit rate 14.5 Mbps, maximum bit rate 19.0 Mbps\nAudio: AC-3, 6 channels (Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE), 448 Kbps, 48.0 Khz\nSize: 686 MiB\nDuration: 6:16\n(includes intro)\n\nFile in same form as found, with lineage unknown.\n\nCaps n Banner c/o Capt.

To celebrate this achievement, the Teen Choice Awards becomes the site of the night of the world debut of Miley's new single due out the next day, &quot;Party in the U.S.A.&quot; Miley was just sweet 16 at the time of her big coming out party in the U.S.A. Her latest single would become her biggest to date, reaching #2 on The Hot 100. \n\nPer wiki, &quot;for the 2011 Guinness World Records, Miley was named the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Most Charted TeenagerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ following her 29th US Billboard Hot 100 chart entry on November 7, 2009 with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Party in the U.S.A.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½. She has attained a total of six Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, and had five RIAA certified albums by the age of 18.&quot;\n\nBut then a funny thing happened: Miley went away. Miley's last single to be released in the USA came the following May, with 2010's &quot;Can't Be Tamed.&quot;\n\nHurry up and wait! Miley is back like she never left cause she never really did.
