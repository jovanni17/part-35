It was written by screen writer Paul Laverty and directed by English director Ken Loach. The film's cast includes former professional footballer Eric Cantona and former bassist with The Fall, Steve Evets.\n\nDirector Ken Loach said of the film, &quot;We wanted to deflate the idea of celebrities as more than human. And we wanted to make a film that was enjoying the idea of what you and I would call solidarity, but what others would call support for your friends really, and the old idea that we are stronger as a team than we are as individuals.\n\n\n\nWhen the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they want you to seed this at a decent speed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:110a09f8f43515f7d778b3b1e3bab2a803026827","amp;dn":"Looking+For+Eric+DVDRip+TSV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"110a09f8f43515f7d778b3b1e3bab2a803026827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,10,9,248,244,53,21,247,215,120,179,177,227,186,178,168,3,2,104,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
