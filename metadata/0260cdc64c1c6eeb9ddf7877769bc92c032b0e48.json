Many mathematical methods are essential to the modeling and analysis of the geological, geophysical, and environmental processes widely studied in earth sciences. This book provides an introduction to the fundamental mathematics that all earth scientists need. Assuming nor more than a standard secondary school level as its starting point, the book is self-contained and provides an essential toolkit of basic mathematics for earth scientists. The topics of earth sciences are vast and multidisciplinary, and consequently the mathematical tools required by its students are diverse and complex. Introductory Mathematics for Earth Scientists strikes a fine balance between coverage and detail. Topics have been selected to provide a concise but comprehensive introductory coverage of all the major and popular mathematical methods. The book offers a 'theorem-free' approach with an emphasis on practicality. With dozens of step-by-step worked examples, the book is especially suitable for non-mathematicians and geoscientists. The topics include binomial theorem, index notations, polynomials, sequences and series, trigonometry, spherical trigonometry, complex numbers, vectors and matrices, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, Fourier transforms, numerical methods, and geostatistics. Introductory Mathematics for Earth Scientists introduces a wide range of fundamental and widely-used, mathematical methods. This book is ideal for both undergraduate students and postgraduate students. Additionally, it is a helpful reference for more advanced scientists.\n\n\n# Paperback: 228 pages\n# Publisher: Dunedin Academic Press Ltd.
