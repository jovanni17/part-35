Thus, no one believes him when he claims to have seen a murder in a neighboring apartment. No one, that is, except the killers (Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman). Realizing he won't get any help from his parents (Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy) or the law, the boy must figure out a way to save himself from being shut up permanently by the murderers. The film's hair-rising and oft-imitated climax, which takes place in a rotting abandoned tenement, has lost none of its edge over the past five decades. A much-needed hit for financially strapped RKO Radio Pictures, The Window was remade in 1960 as The Boy Cried Murder.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042046/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042046/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-54937&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-54937&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:12:44\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x528  4/3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1074 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,12 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f381582b99ee48929bdff6095773199c160884","amp;dn":"The+Window+%281949%29+Barbara+Hale+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f381582b99ee48929bdff6095773199c160884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,243,129,88,43,153,238,72,146,155,223,246,9,87,115,25,156,22,8,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
