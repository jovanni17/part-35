Fortunately itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s only taken Team 17 about 10 years to pull off a similar trick for their Worms. Not bad going in the Darwinian Derby stakes.\n\nSo Worms 3D on the Mac? Yes indeedy - the third generation of Worms has gone all 3 dimensional on us, but before any flat earthers start getting fidgety, let's make this clear ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ it has retained all the best bits. Team 17 have made a superb job of making flatworms into roundworms (bad puns are part of the deal) - none of this &quot;it's in 3 dimensions and none of them are fun&quot; malarkey. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.feralinteractive.com/?game=worms3d&amp;subsection=home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.feralinteractive.com/?game=worms3d&amp;subsection=home&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9343cb5cd23a099dedab1fa1c836bd8a97fea959","amp;dn":"Worms+3D+%5BUB%5D+%5Bk%5C%27ed%5D+MAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9343cb5cd23a099dedab1fa1c836bd8a97fea959","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,67,203,92,210,58,9,157,237,171,31,161,200,54,189,138,151,254,169,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
