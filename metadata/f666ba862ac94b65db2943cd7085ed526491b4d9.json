Screened by BBC and PBS.\n\nIf you have seen and enjoyed Ken Burns legendary documentary mini-series, The American Civil War, then you will not be disappointed by The West.\nBurns employs the same techniques (letters, photos, old maps, drawings with Hollywood actors providing the voices and historians occasionally fleshing out the tones) to tell the story of the American West. It is a wonderful story told from every angle. If you enjoy American history and value good film-making, then do not miss this wonderful documentary series. \n\n\nIn a conversation with us several years ago, the Kiowa poet N. Scott Momaday remarked that the American West &quot;is a place that has to be seen to be believed, and it may have to be believed in order to be seen.&quot; For five years we have travelled that landscape, photographed its vistas, talked to its people, sought out its history, all as part of our production of THE WEST, an eight-part documentary series for public television.\n\n\n8 parts, 8 files, DivX\n\t\t\n\nNo missing files.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f666ba862ac94b65db2943cd7085ed526491b4d9","amp;dn":"BBC%2C+PBS%2C+Ken+Burns+-+The+West%2C+USA+History%2C+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f666ba862ac94b65db2943cd7085ed526491b4d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,102,186,134,42,201,75,101,219,41,67,205,112,133,237,82,100,145,180,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
