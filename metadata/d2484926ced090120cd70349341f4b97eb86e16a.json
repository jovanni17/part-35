Upon landing, however, the plane breaks a wheel when it runs over the camp's radio, which was laying mysteriously in the runway. They all soon discover that the entire camp is missing, and they fear that local cannibals may be responsible. Their pilot fixes the plane, but they must wait for morning to fly. During the night, the pilot's girlfriend, Swan, is taken by the cannibals. When looking for her in the morning, the pilot is also killed. Rolf and Robert become lost and are soon separated in a raft accident. Robert is captured by the cannibals and faces certain tortures and humiliations until he escapes with a cannibal woman. The two then set out to find Rolf and the plane, with the cannibal tribe right on their heels..\n\nFor some reason this was an absolute bugger to rip?!?!\n\nimdb info: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078437/\n\n\nDon't forget to seed everyone.... and enjoy ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2484926ced090120cd70349341f4b97eb86e16a","amp;dn":"Jungle+Holocaust+-+DVDRip+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2484926ced090120cd70349341f4b97eb86e16a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,72,73,38,206,208,144,18,12,215,3,73,52,31,75,151,235,134,225,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
