The album includes the song &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight),&quot; the band's most-used set-closing song for the first 10 years of its career.\n\nAs with Springsteen's first album, it was well-received critically but had little commercial success at the time. However, once Springsteen achieved popularity with Born to Run, several selections from this album became popular FM radio airplay and concert favorites.\n\nThe E Street Band is known to have taken its name from David Sancious' mother's home in Belmar, New Jersey. But based on first-hand recounts of Sancious, the 'shuffle' occurred when the band's rented truck broke down late one night after a gig in New York City. Snowing, but within walking distance of Sancious' mother's home, the band decided to walk the short distance. The back photo on the album has the six band members standing in a doorway. The picture was of an antique store on Sairs Ave in the west end section of Long Branch, New Jersey. The building was across the street from West End Elementary School, and for years was Tommy Reeds bicycle repair shop and penny candy store; sadly, it is now a parking lot.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 132 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[2] On November 7, 2009, Springsteen and the E Street Band played the album in its entirety for the first time ever in a concert at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\nAll tracks composed by Bruce Springsteen\n\n Side one\n&quot;The E Street Shuffle&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:31 \n&quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 5:36 \n&quot;Kitty's Back&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 7:09 \n&quot;Wild Billy's Circus Story&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:47 \nSide two\n&quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 7:45 \n&quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 7:04 \n&quot;New York City Serenade&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 9:55 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af77675a7949b7443965f16fed67ab151ae29a27","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen...The+Wild%2C+the+Innocent+%26+the+E+Street+Shuffl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af77675a7949b7443965f16fed67ab151ae29a27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,119,103,90,121,73,183,68,57,101,241,111,237,103,171,21,26,226,154,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
