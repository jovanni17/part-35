His music is primarily acoustic, lacking a highly &quot;produced&quot; sound. Many of his songs, including the hit &quot;He's Alive&quot;, feature a ballad style or speaking through music that interprets or retells Biblical events. Some of his songs, such as &quot;I Don't Care Where You've Been Sleepin'&quot; and &quot;Gotta Tell Somebody&quot;, have been considered controversial in conservative Christian circles.\n\nThe artist has given general permission to copy and distribute all his works freely by any not-for-profit means, as long as his URL is included: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.donfrancisco.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.donfrancisco.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNOTE that the Collections Volumes I-III are re-recordings of selected songs from his early (1976-1994) works. They are the original arrangements and by the original artist, and in my opinion they are very good; but they are not what you heard in the 70's.  If anyone has any of his albums from 1976-1994, please contact me. I would like a copy for myself, and I will add them to a new torrent.\n\nALBUM &amp; TRACK LISTING\n---------------------\nCompilation Albums (re-recordings):\n\nHe's Alive, Collection Vol. I (1996)\n 1.
