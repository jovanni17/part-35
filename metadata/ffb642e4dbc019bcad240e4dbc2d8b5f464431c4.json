Zeke and Luke work in a sex shop: Zeke takes gay liberation seriously, Luke likes to sparkle and takes nothing seriously. He's offended when Stephen calls him a gay clichÃƒÂ©, then, surprisingly, they find each other attractive and interesting. Stephen, it turns out, has a great apartment, trust fund, and artwork he's painted on his walls. Meanwhile, Peter, a neat-freak, and Derek, nice to everyone, move in together. Peter's compulsiveness threatens the relationship. Last, newly-engaged Marilyn, a recovering alcoholic stuck at step 2, can't stop obsessing about wedding details. Can these folks sort out civilization and its discontents?\n\n\n\n\n01:23:07\n640x368\n25 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffb642e4dbc019bcad240e4dbc2d8b5f464431c4","amp;dn":"2007+A+Four+Letter+Word+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffb642e4dbc019bcad240e4dbc2d8b5f464431c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,182,66,228,219,192,25,188,173,36,14,77,188,45,139,95,70,68,49,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
