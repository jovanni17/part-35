Be prepared to shake the house once again with 'Pump up the Jam', Ministry Of Sound's hit-filled collection of classic old school rave anthems. The original rave generation might be approaching middle-age (doesn't time fly when you are having fun?!), but the party never stops when the tracks are this good!\n\n      Opening with Moby's progressive house classic 'Go', with its suitably subtle atmospheric changes, the compilation has enough star names to keep any fan happy. However, it's the representation of the diverse subcultures of the '80s and '90s rave scene that makes this album so appealing. One of the striking things about the album is how influential acid house has been on contemporary music. An independently released top 20 hit in 1989, the acid house classic 'Voodoo Ray' encapsulates the spirit of the early rave movement. Leftfield's techno gem 'Song of Life' features, whilst The Prodigy's relentlessly hardcore 'Voodoo People' shows the band in their pre-vocal prime. The inclusion of the big names alongside less commercially successful, though still influential artists like T99 and Praga Khan lends the compilation a degree of credibility, whilst Praga Khan's old school techno 'Injected With A Poison' will have you scrambling for the glowsticks and chanting: &quot;there's a rainbow inside my mind!&quot;\n\n      The dance-pop of Bizarre Inc.'s 'Playing with knives', Alison Limerick 's club classic 'Where Love Lives', and Sabrina Johnson's 'Peace in the Valley' are the type of tracks that still hold their own against today's club-orientated party music. Ultimately, this compilation will appeal to a wide range of people, from those keen to relive the rave heyday, to those curious about what all the fuss was about, and those who just want some great tunes to party to! Dig out those glow sticks and get smiling!\n\nTrack List\t\n\n \n\n Disc 1\n\n   1. Moby - Go (Woodtick Mix)\n   2. A Guy Called Gerald - Voodoo Ray\n   3. Jaydee - Plastic Dreams\n   4.
