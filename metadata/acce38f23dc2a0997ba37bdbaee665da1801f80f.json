Promoting itself as the drink of freedom, choice and US patriotism, the company&amp;#039;s feel-good factor is recognized worldwide and reflected in its enormous profits.\n\nBut behind this carefully crafted image exists a company accused of environmental damage, human rights violations and questionable business practices.\n\nIn the program we go on journey from the company?s days with a cocaine ingredient, its close collaboration with Nazis, a history of discrimination against black workers, alignment death squads and murder in Colombia, child labor in El Salvador and the depredation of vital water supplies in India and elsewhere. \n\nAt the end of the program, we are tantalized by possible flirtations with neuro-marketing and the undoubted power of its branding and advertising appeal. \n\nThomas, a long-term critic of Coca-Cola&amp;#039;s more controversial practices, finds disturbing evidence which undermines its effervescent image as a force for good and which has prompted a global consumer backlash.
