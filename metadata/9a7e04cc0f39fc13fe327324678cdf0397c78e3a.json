Ward was killed.\n\nIn the video above, via YouTube, you can see Ward apparently confronting Stewart on foot after Ward's car is run into the wall. He is struck, dragged, then thrown a number of feet. According to Ontario County Sheriff Philip C. Povero, Ward was dead on arrival at the hospital.\n\nCMP posted the following to its Facebook page:\n\nTonight's racing events were suspended due to an accident. Please hold off on any speculation until we have further information to share.\nAccidents are, obviously, common in the motorsports world. To shut down a track entirely following one is extreme, and if you look at the above photo you'll notice a major law enforcement presence. That's not standard for an auto racing accident, either. (Fox Sports confirmed law enforcement is looking into the incident.)\n\nHere's how alleged eyewitnesses are telling what happened. Keep the usual caveats about things you hear on the Internet in mind, but the number of people who saw it happenÃ¢â‚¬â€and their previous track records for motorsports reportingÃ¢â‚¬â€suggests the worst.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a7e04cc0f39fc13fe327324678cdf0397c78e3a","amp;dn":"Tony+Stewart+Runs+Over+Driver+2014-08-10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a7e04cc0f39fc13fe327324678cdf0397c78e3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,126,4,204,15,57,252,19,254,50,115,36,103,140,223,3,151,199,142,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
