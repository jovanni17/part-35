The Best of 'Big' John Patton\nYear: 1963-70\nLabel: Blue Note (1994)\nTotal time: 78:03\nBitrage: 320 kbps\n\nSuper 78-minute anthology of Patton's prime (1963-70) era, unfortunately released only in the U.K., drawn from nine albums. 1963's \n\n&quot;Along Came John,&quot; and 1966's &quot;Amanda,&quot; and the two cuts from his best album, 1965's Let 'Em Roll ( &quot;The Turnaround&quot; and \n\n&quot;Latona&quot; ) are particular cookers, but the organ-guitar-horn groove is always solid, and the riffs basic but compelling.  This is some of \n\nthe best soul-jazz ever, usually featuring Grant Green on guitar, though a young James Ulmer takes over on axe for the 1970-era cuts. \n\n~ Richie Unterberger, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Patton (Organ) \nGrant Green (Guitar) - 1-9 \nBen Dixon (Drums) - 1-6 \nFred Jackson (Tenor Saxophone) - 1,2,4 \nHarold Vick (Tenor Saxophone) - 1,2,6 \nGeorge Braith (Soprano Saxophone and Strich) - 3,5 \nTommy Turrentine (Trumpet) - 3,5 \nRichard Williams (Trumpet) - 4 \nBlue Mitchell (Trumpet) - 6 \nHugh Walker (Drums) - 7,10 \nRichard Landrum (Conga) - 7 \nBobby Hutcherson (Vibes) - 8,9 \nOtis Finch (Drums) - 8,9 \nHarold Alexander (Flute and Tenor Saxophone) - 10 \nMarvin Cabell (Flute and Tenor Saxophone, Saxello) - 11,12 \nJames Ulmer (Guitar) - 11,12 \nLarry Hancock (Drums) - 11 \nLeroy Williams (Drums) - 12 \n\nJohn Patton - The Organization!
