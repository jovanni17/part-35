Moom's panel appears, and you then click the desired action.\n\nWhen used via the keyboard, a hot key displays the Moom bezel, and you can then use the arrow and modifier keys to move and resize the windows.\n\nYou can also save window layouts, create custom controls with shortcuts that work globally or work only when Moom's keyboard bezel is onscreen.\n\nRelease notes\nMoom 2.4 - Feb 28 2012\n- New Features\n\nCustom controls can now be chained together, so they run sequentially with just one Moom invocation.\n\n* Bug Fixes and Improvements\n\n* Reorganized Moom's menu bar menu to put often-used commands\n  near the top.\n\n* Custom Controls that use F-key shortcuts should now properly show\n  in Moom's menus. (Hat tip to Matthias F. for finding this one.)\n\n* Moom now checks if it's hidden at launch, and asks the user to unhide\n  if that's the case.\n\n* Fixed a timing issue related to bringing windows in saved layouts to\n  the foreground. (Hat tip to Boone S. for finding this one.)\n\n* Fixed an issue that affected some windows with attached sheets. (Hat\n  tip to Andy K. for finding this one.)\n\n* Changed the way grid resize and spacing settings interact. (Hat tip to\n  Dominik W. for the suggestion.)\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS version: Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or higher\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d6e98911e44b8329738497f68c5254baa1bb71b","amp;dn":"Moom+v.+2.4+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d6e98911e44b8329738497f68c5254baa1bb71b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,110,152,145,30,68,184,50,151,56,73,127,104,197,37,75,170,27,183,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
