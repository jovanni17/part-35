He becomes their stalker.\n\nThe Faithful and the Foul is a dark comedy, low budget, independent, art house, feature-length movie. What it lacks in production, it makes up for in story and acting and film-making.\n\nHelmed by Aaron Hendren, this darkly comic indie tale follows a social reject who splits his time between stalking his dream girl and turning life into a nightmare for a couple who committed the unpardonable sin of chatting it up during a movie. Riffing on the 1980s films of director John Hughes, The Faithful and the Foul stars Abigail Blueher, Chad Brummett, Dodie Montgomery, Summer Olsson and Babak Tafti.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7f1d2ff8b11155872bcb8cf6b4fa3442bf5ccd9","amp;dn":"The+Faithful+and+the+Foul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7f1d2ff8b11155872bcb8cf6b4fa3442bf5ccd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,241,210,255,139,17,21,88,114,188,184,207,107,79,163,68,43,245,204,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
