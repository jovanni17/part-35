He was an important influence on the folk scene in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nn April 1958 Darling replaced Pete Seeger in The Weavers, although he continued working club dates with The Tarriers until November 1959. Darling also recorded three solo albums. His second solo effort, True Religion for Vanguard in 1961 was influential on younger folkies of the day. Darling left the Weavers in June 1962 to work as a soloist on the emerging coffeehouse circuit. That summer he formed a jazz-folk trio, The Rooftop Singers, with longtime friend Bill Svanoe and jazz singer Lynn Taylor. \t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:552127ab6432557b0dccd2ce24f42951fc2a1a3d","amp;dn":"Erik+Darling+-+Erik+Darling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"552127ab6432557b0dccd2ce24f42951fc2a1a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,33,39,171,100,50,85,123,13,204,210,206,36,244,41,81,252,42,26,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
