Soon the trio was forced to put aside the project, as they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find the right members to fill the band up.[3]\nAfter a long period of other experiences in various band (Klimt 1918, Spiritual Front, Grimness), they rejoined again and found the spur to take in the old doom metal project again. Soon they were joined by drum player Jonah Padella and bass guitar player Davide Pesola, two old acquaintances of the underground metal scene in Rome. A couple of months later they engaged Marco Benevento, vocalist and mastermind of the Italian doom band How Like a Winter, who was the missing link to complete the line up.\n\n\nDiscography \n\nDays of Nothing - (2007)\nOionos - (2010)\nSecond World - (2012)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c813581437405e4f9c7c46886e090543a40eb9d","amp;dn":"The+Foreshadowing+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c813581437405e4f9c7c46886e090543a40eb9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,129,53,129,67,116,5,228,249,199,196,104,134,224,144,84,58,64,235,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
