Returning home to Fort Worth, Texas in 1983 as a famed performer and composer, documentary footage, dramatic scenes, and some of the first music video-style segments ever made, chronicle his boyhood in segregated Texas and his subsequent emergence as an American cultural pioneer and world-class icon. Among those who contribute to the film include William Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Buckminster Fuller, Don Cherry, Yoko Ono, Charlie Haden, Robert Palmer, Jayne Cortez and John Rockwell.\n\nOrnette: Made in America is essential for anyone hoping to understand the history of jazz and the fertile creative exchange that highlighted the 60's and 70's in America. It is a portrayal of the inner life of an artist-innovator.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b4244b3fb7184cadc55f47bea7d30055ed5bb83","amp;dn":"Ornette%3A+Made+in+America+%28Shirley+Clarke%2C+1985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b4244b3fb7184cadc55f47bea7d30055ed5bb83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,66,68,179,251,113,132,202,220,85,244,123,234,125,48,5,94,213,187,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
