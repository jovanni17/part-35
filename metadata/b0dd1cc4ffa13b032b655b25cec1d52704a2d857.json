But six years after their wedding, they learned that Elliot, only 55, had pancreatic cancerÃ¢â‚¬â€and would be lucky to live for a year or two. With a journalist's eye for intimate detail, Leslie shows how they made the very most of the time they had left together. Told with heart, humor and compelling immediacy, The Last Kiss is a love story about the life-affirming power of a passionate marriage, the importance of loyal friends, and the resilience of children growing up through one of life's harshest trials. This is the most important story she has ever told","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0dd1cc4ffa13b032b655b25cec1d52704a2d857","amp;dn":"The+Last+Kiss+-+Leslie+Brody","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0dd1cc4ffa13b032b655b25cec1d52704a2d857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,221,28,196,255,161,59,3,43,101,91,37,206,193,213,39,4,162,216,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
