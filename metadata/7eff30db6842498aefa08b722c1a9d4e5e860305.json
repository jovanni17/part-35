She is a big city fashion editor who is looking for peace and quiet while Franklin is a local who sees her as a snob. They are soon drawn to together when a giant creature seems to appear in the woods just outside Charlotte's cabin. Franklin's patrol car is overturned and her telephone is suddenly out of order. Together, they will have to overcome their fears and deal with the extra-terrestrial creature that has appeared, which turns out to be something altogether unexpected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eff30db6842498aefa08b722c1a9d4e5e860305","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+The+Fear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eff30db6842498aefa08b722c1a9d4e5e860305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,255,48,219,104,66,73,138,239,160,139,114,44,26,157,78,94,134,3,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
