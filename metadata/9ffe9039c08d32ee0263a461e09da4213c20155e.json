Barraclough combines ambitious historical sweep with an on-theground investigation of contemporary life in this iconic western suburb. She is particularly intrigued by the ValleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many rural elements, such as dirt roads, tack-and-feed stores, horse-keeping districts, citrus groves, and movie ranches. Far from natural or undeveloped spaces, these rural characteristics are, she shows, the result of deliberate urbanplanning decisions that have shaped the Valley over the course of more than a hundred years.\n \nThe ValleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entwined history of urban development and rural preservation has real ramifications today for patterns of racial and class inequality and especially for the evolving meaning of whiteness. Immersing herself in meetings of homeownersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ associations, equestrian organizations, and redistricting committees, Barraclough uncovers the racial biases embedded in rhetoric about Ã¢â‚¬Å“open spaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“western heritage.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The ValleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s urban cowboys enjoy exclusive, semirural landscapes alongside the opportunities afforded by one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest cities. Despite this enviable position, they have at their disposal powerful articulations of both white victimization and, with little contradiction, color-blind politics.\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Extraordinarily good . . . An important contribution to studies of the Los Angeles basin, the book ought to have wider appeal among scholars of racial formation, suburbanization, and the development of the American West.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Don Mitchell, author of The Lie of the Land: Migrant Workers and the California Landscape\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Deftly blending social history and cultural critique, BarracloughÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine book forces us to think in new ways about the relationships between rural and urban areas, between the suburb and the city, and between the past and the present.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€George Lipsitz, author of The Possessive Investment in Whiteness Geography / Urban Studies\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A fine addition to the growing literature on Los Angeles and suburbia, as well as whiteness and the complicated history of landscape preservation. . . . [I]t connects the San Fernando Valley to regional, national, and global history. In telling the making of the distinctive landscape of the San Fernando Valley, Barraclough has written a book relevant to any reader interested in modern U.S. cities, suburbs, and society.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Lawrence Culver, Environmental History\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“BarracloughÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chief insight is discerning how those linking suburbia to the mythic west have managed purposefully to construct racial identities and maintain white privilege in the San Fernando Valley (and elsewhere in the west). The book is a richly detailed, lucidly written, and astute history of the San Fernando Valley. It belongs alongside other important histories of the region by Kevin Starr, Robert Fogelson, William Fulton, Becky M. Nicolaides, and too few others.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Ronald A. Davidson, Journal of Historical Geography\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“To [the] list of must-reads, Angelenos especially should add Laura BarracloughÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Making the San Fernando Valley. . . .She offers some sharp insights into the historical pressures and contemporary dilemmas confronting a once-rural landscape. . . .spot on.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Char Miller, Southern California Quarterly\nAbout the Author\n\nLaura R. Barraclough is an assistant professor of sociology at Kalamazoo College. She is a native of the San Fernando Valley and received degrees from the University of Southern California and the University of California San Diego.\n\nFile Size: 3523 KB\nPrint Length: 316 pages\nPublisher: University of Georgia Press (January 1, 2011)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B004HINJI6\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Making-Fernando-Valley-Transformation-ebook/dp/B004HINJI6/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Making-Fernando-Valley-Transformation-ebook/dp/B004HINJI6/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTags: racism, white privilege, anglo, europe, european, caucasian, white, black, people of color, latino, latin-american, class, sociology, oppression, blindness, double standard, discrimination, oppression, polarization, unconcious, african studies, ethics, philosophy, tim wise, california, usa, america, san fernando, valley, cowboy, rural, west, racial tension, whitewash, narrative, victim, victimization, \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ffe9039c08d32ee0263a461e09da4213c20155e","amp;dn":"Making+the+San+Fernando+Valley%3A+Rural+Landscapes%2C+Urban+Developm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ffe9039c08d32ee0263a461e09da4213c20155e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,254,144,57,192,141,50,238,2,99,164,97,224,157,164,33,60,32,21,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
