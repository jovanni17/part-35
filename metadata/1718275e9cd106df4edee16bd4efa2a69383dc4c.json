Led by their &quot;boss&quot; Guy Tenby, the Convict Commandos are thrown into the middle of an assassination plot in Yugoslavia.\n\nThey're used to being kept in the dark by Guy but this time, even he doesn't seem to know what's going on. And that could have fatal consequences for all of them.\n\nCommando #4552 - The Sergeant and the Squad (2012)\nBy Ferg Handley\n\nHe was a tough loner, a veteran of the war in Far East, a survivor of the terrors of the jungle and a hundred brutal fights against the Japanese. The last thing he wanted was to take a group of raw recruits under his wing.\n\nTo them he was more a like a machine than a man Ã¢â‚¬â€˜ and a killing machine at that - gruff, remorseless and cold. To them was the only man who could get them through the war.\n\nBut some of those rookies worried that they'd end up just like... The Sergeant.\n\nCommando #4553 - Sky Ace (2012)\nBy Maitland\n\nThis is the inside story of two ace British fighter pilots, and the strange and deadly rivalry that drove them to outfly, outshoot and outdare each other through every risky second of their dog-fights with the mighty Luftwaffe.\n\nThey did things with fighters no aircraft were built to do, writing the story of their feuds with each other in the skies over Southern England in the flaming wreckage of dozens of Nazi planes. They became a legend in their own lifetimes.\n\nBetween these covers, for the first time, is their glorious story.\n\nCommando #4554 - The Chef Who Went To War (2012)\nBy Alan Hebden\n\nStanley Simpson couldn't stand life in the Catering Corps.
