The issue barely comes up with any substance in our current political dialogue. But bringing climate change back into our national conversation is as much a communications challenge as it is a scientific one.\n\nThis week, in an encore broadcast, scientist Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, joins Bill to describe his efforts to galvanize communities over whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arguably the greatest single threat facing humanity. Leiserowitz, who specializes in the psychology of risk perception, knows better than anyone if people are willing to change their behavior to make a difference.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[A] pervasive sense up to now has been that climate change is distant Ã¢â‚¬â€ distant in time, and distant in space,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Leiserowitz tells Bill. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re now beginning to see is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not so distant. I have a nine-year-old son Ã¢â‚¬â€ heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to be my age in the year 2050. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want him to live in the world that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re currently hurtling towards.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe show also includes a short video portrait of photographic artist Chris Jordan, whose work helps us understand the scope of American consumerism and consumption.\n\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a6652363aeef6f421c5cd6c1a6942c310af07fd","amp;dn":"Ending+the+Silence+on+Climate+Change-PBS+Moyers+and+Company+0315","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a6652363aeef6f421c5cd6c1a6942c310af07fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,102,82,54,58,238,246,244,33,197,205,108,26,105,66,195,16,175,7,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
