Using secret documents, cabinet papers, intelligence reports, military orders, diaries and letters, Michael Portillo pieces together the story of this uprising from the British point of view.\r\n\r\nWas Dublin just another battle at a time of war where military justice was immediate and brutal or, by their actions, did the British men who wrote these documents hasten the end of an empire? Did an unlikely band of Irish rebels, led by playwrights and poets, do more to advance the cause of Irish freedom in five days than nationalist politicians had done in the previous 50 years, or did they damage the cause and condemn the island to a history of violence? Michael looks for the answers. This is the story of Ireland's Easter Rising as told by British politicians, soldiers, spies and bureaucrats.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/Easter-1916-The-Enemy-Files-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/Easter-1916-The-Enemy-Files-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/Easter-1916-The-Enemy-Files-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/Easter-1916-The-Enemy-Files-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/Easter-1916-The-Enemy-Files-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/Easter-1916-The-Enemy-Files-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/43/Easter-1916-The-Enemy-Files-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/Easter-1916-The-Enemy-Files-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/78/Easter-1916-The-Enemy-Files-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1350Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 58 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 621 MB\r\n * Container: MP4\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075f1f2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5a4901f6d13bdd3e7a7814bcd2ef84ae9c1c699","amp;dn":"BBC+Easter+1916+The+Enemy+Files+720p+x265+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5a4901f6d13bdd3e7a7814bcd2ef84ae9c1c699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,164,144,31,109,19,189,211,231,167,129,75,205,46,248,74,233,193,198,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
