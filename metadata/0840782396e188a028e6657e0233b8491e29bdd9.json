Miss Christie apparently had one enormous hit in the US of A with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œkazoo symphonicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I Love OnionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and as Keith Darcy ponders in the liner notes, this may well be the reason for her subsequent vanishing from our global hit parade and well, musical history really. Well, WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve not heard that particular song but ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Paint A LadyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is one extraordinary find, the Keepers trio unearthing an album that has actually never been released in any format at all.\n\nConsisting of recently dug-up demos by the albums then producer, the near-legendary John Hill, the most striking facet of the album is its deep, dark and eerie melancholy. The glut of recent folk compilations (St. EtienneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bob StanleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rating amongst the finer end of the spectrum) has resulted in a wealth of great music but often marred by ludicrously self-righteous bullshit penned by smug country folk who have done one from the city. Well, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fine, but leave it to the non-smokers and the born-agains.\n\nBut not here Jack, no way. Within the first minute of the album, ChristieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gorgeous, glacially warm (yeah yeah, I know) has serenely deadpanned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlonely nights/ 8000 sights/ of times I once knewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ set to strings Nick Drake would have been proud of and underpinned by a funky rock beat and some truly blitzed acoustic guitar. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Paint A LadyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ tread a similar conceit to BroadcastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sublime ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Colour Me InÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ urging its protagonists (us I guess) to paint a lady so that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthen you will not have/ to go on living/ life aloneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and which is preceded by the quite frankly chilling lines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtick tock/ time comes and then its gone/ tick tock/ in the end its faced aloneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“For The Love Of A SoldierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ has Susan singing from outer space and making a man out of a boy who goes to war with a one-way ticket. Perhaps most extraordinary though is the 9 minute centre-piece 'Yesterday, WhereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s My Mind' which has a 3 minute spoken intro by Christie over a solo drum beat which results in her literally screaming and damning God before moving in to 7 minutes of acid country folk.\n\nA sympathetic remastering job hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite quashed the demo feel though but this simply adds to the already strange and intense atmosphere and even the familiarity of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ghost Riders In The SkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t spoil the spell.\n\nIts not all doom though. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“When Love ComesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a simply lovely slice of beat-pop, string quartet, multi-tracked vocals and hook after hook after hook. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Paint A LadyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ finally lays down with the Bacharachesque stylings of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“No One Can Hear You CryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, Christie doing Springfield and indeed, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a poignant moment as you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help feel that there weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been robbed of a potentially magical pop career.\n\nAt least we have this. Wonderful.\n\n\ncd ripped by my friend\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0840782396e188a028e6657e0233b8491e29bdd9","amp;dn":"Susan+Christie...Paint+A+Lady%281969%29%28cd+2006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0840782396e188a028e6657e0233b8491e29bdd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,64,120,35,150,225,136,160,40,230,101,126,2,51,184,73,30,41,189,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
