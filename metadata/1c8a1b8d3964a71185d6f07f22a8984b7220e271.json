As an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team tactfully navigates the streets of present-day Iraq, they face the constant threat of death from incoming bombs and sharp-shooting snipers. In Baghdad, roadside bombs are a common danger. The Army is working to make the city a safer place for Americans and Iraqis, so when it comes to dismantling IEDs (improvised explosive devices) the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) crew is always on their game. But protecting the public isn't easy when there's no room for error, and every second spent dismantling a bomb is another second spent flirting with death. Now, as three fearless bomb technicians take on the most dangerous job in Baghdad, it's only a matter of time before one of them gets sent to &quot;the hurt locker.&quot; Jeremy Renner, Guy Pearce, and Ralph Fiennes star.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty\r\nDIRECTOR......: Kathryn Bigelow\r\nWRITERS.......: Mark Boal\r\nGENRE.........: War\r\nMETASCORE.....: 94\r\nIMDB RATING...: 7.6/10  332,701 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 10mn\r\nSIZE..........: 5.11GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1040\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.78:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (3-pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English E-AC3 5.1 512kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary with Kathryn Bigelow\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG   \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Untouched Blu Ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-03-16","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c8a1b8d3964a71185d6f07f22a8984b7220e271","amp;dn":"The+Hurt+Locker+%282008%29+1080p+BluRay+x264+EAC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c8a1b8d3964a71185d6f07f22a8984b7220e271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,138,27,141,57,100,167,17,133,214,240,127,34,168,152,75,114,32,226,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
