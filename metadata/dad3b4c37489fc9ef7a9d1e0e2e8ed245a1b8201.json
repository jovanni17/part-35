But soon he was transforming the way the team played, melding the famous English defensive spine of Adams, Keown, Dixon, Winterburn and Seaman with a hugely creative foreign attacking spirit, epitomised by Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry and Robert Pires. At the same time, he introduced new ideas on diet, fitness and professionalism, which many players believe extended their careers. \r\nHaving won numerous trophies, and led the Invincibles to an unbeaten league season in 2003-04, Wenger then had to help the club through the next stage of their development when they moved from Highbury to the Emirates. Despite the financial constraints he faced, he still managed to keep the club playing in the Champions League year after year while remaining true to his philosophy of how the game should be played. Furthermore, he once again began to build a trophy-winning squad, winning back-to-back FA Cups in 2014 and 2015, that was admired by football fans everywhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad3b4c37489fc9ef7a9d1e0e2e8ed245a1b8201","amp;dn":"+The+Inside+Story+of+Arsenal+Under+Wenger+by+John+Cross","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad3b4c37489fc9ef7a9d1e0e2e8ed245a1b8201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,211,180,195,116,137,252,158,247,169,209,224,226,232,237,36,90,27,130,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
