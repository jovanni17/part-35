As computers become more powerful, it becomes possible to run a great many programs at the same time. This can make the desktop and its task bar crowded and unmanageable. To combat this overload, Screen-It creates 2 virtual desktops (screen pages) on your single physical one. Only one screen page is visible at a time. This program can also launch a number of programs automatically when it starts-up, in a fresh screen or virtual desktop, saving you from having to manually launch a group of programs each time you need to do a certain job. 32 bit Freeware program.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theabsolute.net/sware/#screenit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theabsolute.net/sware/#screenit&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theabsolute.net/sware/files/screenit.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theabsolute.net/sware/files/screenit.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDeskscan is freeware.
