It stars Ivan Dixon, Abbey Lincoln, Julius Harris, Gloria Foster, Martin Priest, Leonard Parker, and Yaphet Kotto.\n\nThe movie was written by Michael Roemer and Robert M. Young and directed by Roemer. The film has been deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\nNothing But a Man was reputedly the favorite film of Malcolm X.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-----From Black Independent Cinema and the Influence of Neo-Realism by Chris Norton-----\n\nNothing But a Man is an impressive study of black masculinity and the oppressive racial climate of 1960s America. However, this film is complicated by several factors. The first of which is that the director, Michael Roemer, is not black but white. The film is also not part of the black independent film movement but rather what Donald Bogle calls &quot;Black Art Films.&quot; Bogle says, &quot;[Appearing] during the first half of the 1960s, a quartet of inexpensively but sensitively made motion pictures offered grimly realistic and cynical looks at black America&quot; (200). Other films of this sub-genre included John Cassavetes&amp;#039; Shadows (1961), Shirley Clarke&amp;#039;s The Cool World (1963) and Sam Weston and Larry Peerce&amp;#039;s One Potato, Two Potato (1964). Nothing But a Man, positioned before the effects of the Black Power rebellion, coupled with Killer of Sheep coming after the height of the rebellion, demonstrate how little life in the Black community had changed despite the legitimization of the civil rights movement and the fury wrought by the black power rebellion of the late 1960s. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
