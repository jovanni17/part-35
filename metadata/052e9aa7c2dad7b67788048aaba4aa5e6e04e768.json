A Hindu, as per definition, is an adherent of the \nspiritual practices, yoga, philosophies and scriptures of Hindu Dharma.\n\n\n\nThe Hindu tradition is solely responsible for the creation of such original concepts and \npractices as Yoga, Ayurveda, Vastu, Jyotish, yagna, Puja, Tantra, Vedanta, Karma, Chakras,\nBrahman, Atman etc.\n\n\nORIGIN:\n\n\nThe Hindu Dharma or Sanatana Dharma has its origins in such remote past that \nit cannot be traced to any one individual. It is the only religion, that is not founded \nin a single historic event or prophet, but which itself precedes recorded history. \nSome scholars view that Hinduism must have existed even in circa 10,000 B.C. and \nthat the earliest of the Hindu scriptures ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Rigveda ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was composed well \nbefore 6,500 B.C. Yet, in spite of the fact that it first evolved more than 5,000 years ago,\n Hinduism is also very much a living tradition.\n\nThe word 'Hindu' has its origin in Sanskrit literature. In the Rigveda, \nBharat is referred to as the country of 'Sapta Sindhu', i.e. \nthe country of seven great rivers. The word 'Sindhu' refers to rivers and \nsea and not merely to the specific river called 'Sindhu'. In Vedic Sanskrit, \naccording to ancient dictionaries, 'sa' was pronounced as 'ha'. \nThus 'Sapta Sindhu' was pronounced as 'Hapta Hindu'. \nThis is how the word 'Hindu' came in to being.\n\nThe term was used for those who lived in Bharatavarsha1 (the Indian subcontinent) on or \nbeyond the &quot;Sindhu&quot;. Since the end of the 18th century the word has been used as \nan umbrella term for most of the religious, spiritual, and philosophical traditions of the \nsub-continent, that includes other sampradaya (spiritual lineages) of Sikhism, Buddhism, \nand Jainism. It generally denotes the religious, philosophical, scientific and \ncultural traditions native to India.\n\n\n\n\nPLZ SEED THIS DIVINE TORRENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE..DONT HIT AND RUN..\n\nANYONE WHO WANT TO SAVE HINDUISM WILL SEED THIS TORRENT DEFINITELY...\n\nHOPE YOU WILL BE ONE AMONG THEM..THIS GIVES YOU ABOUT A BRIEF KNOWLEDGE ON HINDU DHARMA..\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\nANY ONE CAN SPREAD GOOD MESSAGE IF THEY HAVE NICE, PEACEFUL HEART..\n\nPLZ SEED GUYZ...\n\nTHANK YOU..\n\n\nPLZ SEED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE..I AM LACKING SEEDS...\n\n\nAND A VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL.!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:052e9aa7c2dad7b67788048aaba4aa5e6e04e768","amp;dn":"A+Catechism+of+Hindu+Dharma+For+Beginners","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"052e9aa7c2dad7b67788048aaba4aa5e6e04e768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,46,154,167,194,218,215,182,119,136,4,138,171,164,170,94,110,4,231,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
