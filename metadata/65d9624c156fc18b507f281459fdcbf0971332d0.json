In addition to acid-tinged garage rockers such as the crazed-love anthem, \\\\\\&quot;You\\\\\\&amp;#039;re Gonna Miss Me,\\\\\\&quot; the Elevators\\\\\\&amp;#039; debut included tracks such as \\\\\\&quot;Reverberation (Doubt),\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Roller Coaster,\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Splash 1,\\\\\\&quot; which viscerally evoked the sounds of their titles while offering lyrics that provided a philosophical structure for the psychedelic experience. The lyrics were written by Tommy Hall, who also played amplified jug. Hard as it may be to believe now, that jug created a weird sound that predicted that burbling synthesizers of modern-day techno. --Jim Derogatis\n\nOther Musiqman Releases: http://home.no.net/atomfis/index.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d9624c156fc18b507f281459fdcbf0971332d0","amp;dn":"The+Psychedelic+Sounds+of+the+13th+Floor+Elevators+%281966%29+-+CD-I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d9624c156fc18b507f281459fdcbf0971332d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,217,98,76,21,111,193,139,80,127,40,20,89,253,203,240,151,19,50,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
