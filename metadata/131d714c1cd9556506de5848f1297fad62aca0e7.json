Once there, Jackson manages to secure a job as a sheriff&amp;#039;s deputy, \nwhile the ever resourceful Nellie becomes the town&amp;#039;s telegrapher.\n\nTogether, they inadvertently put Rita Blanca on the map when young \nJackson succeeds in shooting down all six of the ferocious Yazee brothers in a \ngunfight that brings him lifelong fame but which he can never repeat because \nhis success came purely out of luck. Nellie almost conquers the heart of \nBuffalo Bill, the man she will love most in her long life, and goes to meet, and \nwitness the exploits of Billy the Kid, the Earp brothers, and Doc Holliday.\n\nA big, brilliant saga full of life, love, shootings, real Western heroes and \nvillians, Telegraph Days is Larry McMurtry at his epic best.\n\n----\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nLarry McMurtry is the author of twenty-seven novels, including the Pulitzer \nPrize-winning Lonesome Dove. His other works include two collections of \nessays, three memoirs and more than thirty screenplays. He lives in Archer \nCity, Texas.\n\n----\n\nABOUT THE READER\n\nAnnie Potts, widely known for her role as Mary Jo Shively on Designing \nWomen, has starred in many television shows and series including Joan of \nArcadia, Huff, Dangerous Minds, Any Day Now, and Love and War.
