This is wild stuff, so check it out if you've never heard this sort of music before. The analog rig used to extract the sound from the grooves is near state-of-the-art, producing almost none of the tracking distortion or surface noise normally associated with LPs.\n\nAGP1-157 are available for direct download at two mirror sites:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dream.cs.bath.ac.uk/AvantGardeProject/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dream.cs.bath.ac.uk/AvantGardeProject/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAGP148-173 are now available at http://ubu.com/sound/agp/index.html\n\nAGP169-179 are also available at http://thepiratebay.se/user/human2011\n\nNOTE: All of the AGP installments since 163 are 24-bit, 44.1 kHz FLAC files. The extra bits of quantization reveal more realistic detail using a 24-bit DAC and good audio equipment. To burn these tracks to CD, you will first have to convert them to 16-bit files. This is easily done using the converter tool in Foobar2000 or other software.\n\n=======================================\n\nAGP180 is a transcription of one of the rarest LPs ever to be included in the AGP, which was provided through the generosity of an exceptionally dedicated AGP partisan. It was released on the Romanian label Electrecord, and presents selections from the International Week of New Music in Bucharest, Romania, May 23-30, 1991. This installment celebrates the 20th anniversary of that festival. Track 03 in particular is a treat. \n\nThese are decent-quality live recordings, though not as finely detailed as those included in AGP82. The LP is in exemplary condition, and the pressing is fairly quiet considering that the LP was released only two years after the revolution that brought democracy to Romania. Current Electrecotd CD issues can be found at http://www.electrecord.ro/. \n\nThe LP came with no liner notes or booklet. The installment includes a scan of the front cover, and I have transcribed into a txt file everything on the front and back covers and on the LP labels. \n\nEquipment used for A/D conversion: Linn Akiva phono cartridge, Linn LP12/Lingo turntable, Linn Ekos SE tonearm, Audioquest LeoPard tonearm cable, PS Audio PS2 preamplifier, Kimber PBJ interconnect, M-Audio Audiophile USB A/D converter.\n\nTracks 02 and 03 have the mildest possible de-clicking, but not track 01 because the sound of the software I used couldn't consistently distinguish between LP surface noise and the sound of the trombone.\n\n01 - Vinko Globokar: RES/AS/IN-SPIRIR [8:44]\n02 - Liviu Danceanu: QUASIOPERA (fragment) [15:54]\n03 - Nicolae Brindus: CONCERT PENTRU VIOARA SI ORCHESTRA [25:19]\n\nNOTE: To the best of my knowledge, these recordings are not currently available commercially. If you know otherwise, please let me know ASAP, as I do not wish any artists to be deprived of the royalties that they so richly deserve.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5caaf4e840c675cecb02ee4af96cec0eabc57929","amp;dn":"International+Week+of+New+Music%2C+1991+%28Avant+Garde+Project+180%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5caaf4e840c675cecb02ee4af96cec0eabc57929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,170,244,232,64,198,117,206,203,2,238,74,249,108,236,14,171,197,121,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
