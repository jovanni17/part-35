It also works on the older versions of Windows. This NC clone file manager is inspired on the dual panel idea of the old file manager Norton Commander.\n\nIt has shortcuts to all the Windows 7 special folders and the tabbed interface allows you to organize your data by project. Projects can include files and folders from all over the disk that are somehow connected to that project tab.\n\nWith a new Windows 7 interface WinNc can do all the basic tasks you expect from a file manager like copy, move, delete, compress, uncompress and create links.\n\nBut WinNc also converts audio, burns files on dvd and cd, create iso files and you are able to synchronize your files. From zip files it allows the creation of self extraction .exe files \n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows 7/vista/xp\n\nHomepage: http://www.winnc.com/winnc5\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with given name/key.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f41e08a975fde4fe2202ade9304d4411f1e26005","amp;dn":"WinNC+v5.8.0.0+Multilangual+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f41e08a975fde4fe2202ade9304d4411f1e26005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,30,8,169,117,253,228,254,34,2,173,233,48,77,68,17,241,226,96,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
