She is as dynamic as any of the great violin masters that I listened to in my younger days including Stern or Heifitz. Each track on the CD is a great representation of her talents and I highly recommend this particular product to those that like great music complimented by one of the great violin players of our generation. I just wish that she didn't have to resort to the suggestive poses on the album cover....her musical talents speak for themselves&quot;\n\n&quot;Eventhough this is the First Janine Jansen recording I get to hear, the sound was't bad. The girl really knows her instrumment and the orchestra does a great contibution to the album. However she cannot be called a Vituoso yet and selecting &quot;Schindler's List&quot; main theme by J. Williams doesn't give her any classical attribute. Honestly the album can be in any violinist colection since Danse Rose from Tchaikovsky, Romance from Shostakovich and ultimately Tzigane from Ravel does the job. At this point of her career she's not in the position of making selections. Moreover the Glamorous pictures can be taken out of the CD. Ah! The fact or advertisement that she plays with an Stradivarius doesn't mean the album will be a collectors item. In a wrap up: The album its OK! to me. If You like albums in which the performer mixes different composer at his/her will and don't mind about it, purchase it.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\n01 Tchaikovsky - Danse Russe (Swan Lake)\n02 Khachaturian - Nocturne (Suite Masquerade)\n03 Saint-Saens - Havanaise, op.83\n04 Saint-Saens - Introduction et Rondo Capriccioso, op. 28\n05 Shostakovich - Romance (The Gadfly Suite)\n06 John Wlliams - Schindlers List (Main Theme)\n07 Vaughan Williams - The Lark Ascending\n08 Ravel - Tzigane\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
