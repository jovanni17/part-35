The first, you might remember, was No Angel, a record made when Dido was a part-time backing singer with a tiny budget and no label. When that record&amp;#039;s heartfelt snap-shots of life were released in 1999, nobody, least of all Dido, expected the album to eventually become the planet&amp;#039;s biggest seller of 2001. The similarly affecting follow-up, 2003&amp;#039;s Life For Rent, also burrowed its way into millions of hearts, hitting number one in 26 countries and lighting up the airwaves in many more.\nThis album is full of the joy of making music, says Dido. The process of making it has been a wonderful experience, something to totally cherish. I&amp;#039;ve put every emotion into these songs. And now I just really hope they move people. It&amp;#039;s hard to imagine that they won&amp;#039;t.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec25e370d29b5987e114b66ff52337e9ca29380","amp;dn":"Dido+-+Safe+Trip+Home+%5Bmp3-192-2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec25e370d29b5987e114b66ff52337e9ca29380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,194,94,55,13,41,181,152,126,17,75,102,255,82,51,126,156,162,147,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
