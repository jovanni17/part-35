In December 1973, he traveled to London for five days of recording with a group of British rock musicians.  The result was London Underground, an album tilted much more in a rock direction than the soul and R&amp;B-drenched recordings he had been making for the previous five years.  Highlights on this album include the Rolling Stones' &quot;Bitch&quot; ( then-Stone Mick Taylor played guitar on this album ), Thunderclap Newman's &quot;Something in the Air,&quot; and &quot;Paper Sun,&quot; from the Traffic canon.  The real highlight, however, came about with the addition of Stephane Grappelli on the Donovan pop hit &quot;Mellow Yellow.&quot;  With guitarist Albert Lee adopting a Django Reinhardt stance, the cut is reminiscent of the old Hot Club of France recordings in the '30s.  There are a couple of clunkers here ( &quot;Layla&quot; doesn't work ), but for fans of late-'60s/early-'70s rock, not a bad ride. - AMG\n \nPersonnel:\nHerbie Mann (Flutes) \nMick Taylor (Guitar) - 1-3,6,7 \nAlbert Lee (Guitar)\nPat Rebillot (Keyboards) \nFuzzy Samuels (Bass) - 1-4,6-8 \nAynsley Dunbar (Drums) - 1,3-5,7,8 \nIan McDonald (Alto Saxophone) - 1 \nRobby McIntosh (Drums) - 2,6 \nStephane Grapelli (Violin) - 5 \nAl Gorry (Bass) - 5 \nArmen Halburian (Percussion) - 8 \n\nHerbie Mann - London Underground Tracks:\n01  Bitch (Mick Jagger/Keith Richard) 8:21 \n02  Something In The Air (John Keen) 3:34 \n03  Layla (Eric Clapton/Jim Gordon) 8:08 \n04  Spin Ball (Paddy Kingsland) 1:57 \n05  Mellow Yellow (Donovan Leich) 3:15 \n06  A Whiter Shade Of Pale (Keith Reed/Gary Brooker) 4:46 \n07  Memphis Spoon Bread &amp; Dover Sole (Herbie Mann) 3:50 \n08  Paper Sun (Steve Winwood/Jim Capaldi) 6:41 \n09  You Never Give Me Your Money (John Lennon/Paul McCartney) 4:04 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91baf26ad4471a6f0fa29d8128d5ba8d41721903","amp;dn":"Herbie+Mann+-+London+Underground+%281974%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bsc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91baf26ad4471a6f0fa29d8128d5ba8d41721903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,186,242,106,212,71,26,111,15,162,157,129,40,213,186,141,65,114,25,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
