The film stars Angela Winkler as Blum, Mario Adorf as Kommissar Beizmenne, Dieter Laser as TÃƒÂ¶tges, and JÃƒÂ¼rgen Prochnow as Ludwig.\n\nThe title character is an innocent housekeeper whose life is ruined by an invasive tabloid reporter and a police investigation when the man with whom she has just fallen in love turns out to be a radical bank robber. The film, unlike the novel, ends with a scene at TÃƒÂ¶tges' funeral, with his publisher delivering a hypocritical condemnation of the murder as an infringement on the freedom of the press.\n\nIn interviews for the 2003 Criterion Collection DVD release of the film, SchlÃƒÂ¶ndorff and other crew members argue for the film's continued relevance today, drawing an analogy between the political climate of panic over terrorism in 1970s West Germany and the post-September 11, 2001 situation in the U.S. where unsubstantiated media hype was used to launch the invasion of Iraq.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8768b5767dee95296c737d7479719dc03ba9c44","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Honour+of+Katharina+Blum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8768b5767dee95296c737d7479719dc03ba9c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,118,139,87,103,222,233,82,150,199,55,215,71,151,25,220,3,186,156,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
