It's 1985: the Reagans are in the White House and Death swings the scythe of AIDS. In Manhattan, Prior Walter tells Lou, his lover of four years, he's ill; Lou bolts. As disease and loneliness ravage Prior, guilt invades Lou. Joe Pitt, an attorney who is Mormon and Republican, is pushed by right-wing fixer Roy Cohn toward a job at the Justice Department. Both Pitt and Cohn are in the closet: Pitt out of shame and religious turmoil, Cohn to preserve his power and access. Pitt's wife Harper is strung out on Valium, aching to escape a sexless marriage. An angel invites Prior to be a prophet in death. Pitt's mother and Belize, a close friend, help Prior choose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cbe3683b1723ddffae2f7c337508945e0b135bd","amp;dn":"Angels+in+America+%28TV+mini-series%29+part+2+iso+dvdrip+retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cbe3683b1723ddffae2f7c337508945e0b135bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,190,54,131,177,114,61,223,250,226,247,195,55,80,137,69,224,177,53,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
