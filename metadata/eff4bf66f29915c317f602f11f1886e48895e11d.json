TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also curated a mix of friends and collaborators to guest spots throughout the transmissions. This weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show was hosted by Panda Bear and featured guest DJ sets by Black Dice, Sublime Frequencies and Haunted Graffiti. It also premiered the new Animal Collective single, TodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Supernatural, and two new Panda Bear instrumentals.\n\nIn his mix, Panda Bear rides a wave of sample-based hip-hop by seminal jazzheads like J Dilla, Madlib, and 9th Wonder (on Little BrotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Say It AgainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), peppered with new school electronic jams by the likes of Zomby and AraabMUZIK. The Sublime Frequencies hour is a transmission of foreign radio from Damascus to Bangkok and everywhere in between, surfacing musical gems that may never have been heard if it werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for this set. You can listen to the entire first show on a live loop at radio.myanimalhome.net.\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the track list:\n\nPANDA BEAR\n\n1.
