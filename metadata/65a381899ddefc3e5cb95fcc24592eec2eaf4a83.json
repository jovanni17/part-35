It was first published by Eternity Comics and ran nine issues until 1990 when it was cancelled. The title once again returned to publication in a revamped version in 1993 by Malibu Comics, which Eternity had become an imprint of.\n\nDinosaurs For Hire, along with Ex-Mutants, was merged with the Protectors universe during Malibu's Genesis crossover before being cancelled a second time. While Malibu was purchased by Marvel Comics in 1993, it is unclear whether or not Dinosaurs for Hire was part of that purchase.\n\nDinosaurs For Hire is a satirical comic that is heavy on parody and humor. The primary characters are a T-Rex named Archie who dresses like the Terminator, a Triceratops named Lorenzo who wears a Hawaiian shirt, a one-eyed Stegosaurus named Reese who wields heavy weapons and a pterodactyl named Cyrano. In the comics, the Dinosaurs are mercenaries for hire and exist in the 20th century.\n\nDinosaurs For Hire Fall Classic #1\nPublisher:  Eternity Comics\nPublication Date:  November 1988\n\nWriter:  Tom Mason\nPenciller:  Nigel Tully\nInks and Tones:  Mike Roberts\nCover Illustration and Coloring:  Brooks Hagan\nLettering:  Clem Robins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65a381899ddefc3e5cb95fcc24592eec2eaf4a83","amp;dn":"Dinosaurs+for+Hire+v1+%231-9+%2B+Fall+Classic+%281988-1990%29+%5BEternity%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65a381899ddefc3e5cb95fcc24592eec2eaf4a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,163,129,137,157,222,252,62,92,185,95,204,36,89,46,236,46,175,74,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
