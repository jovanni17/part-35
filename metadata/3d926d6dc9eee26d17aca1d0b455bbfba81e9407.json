Stearns, packs all it can into a year-by-year and region-by-region chronicle of human life on planet Earth. The book is big, the type is small, and the maps and genealogical tables are excellent. Stearns has added more material on women, leisure activities, and demographics to this edition, and the sections on Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America are much different from the previous version. The Encyclopedia of World History is highly recommended for serious history buffs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d926d6dc9eee26d17aca1d0b455bbfba81e9407","amp;dn":"Houghton+Mifflin+-+The+Encyclopedia+of+World+History+%28ENG%29%28CHM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d926d6dc9eee26d17aca1d0b455bbfba81e9407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,146,109,109,201,238,226,109,23,172,161,208,180,85,187,251,168,30,148,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
