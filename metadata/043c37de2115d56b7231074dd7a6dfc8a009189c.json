Eager for a piece of the action, he offers to strong-arm an environmental objector to 'persuade' him to co-operate. Meanwhile, a routine inspection reveals that Frank is not properly licensed to drive in Norway, but rather than undertake the two-month instruction he decides to take a short cut. Stars Steven Van Zandt, Marian Saastad Ottesen and Sven Nordin. (From Norway, in English and Norwegian) \n\n\nSubtitles by SBS AU TV\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043c37de2115d56b7231074dd7a6dfc8a009189c","amp;dn":"Lilyhammer+S01E03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043c37de2115d56b7231074dd7a6dfc8a009189c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,60,55,222,33,21,213,107,114,49,7,77,215,166,223,200,160,9,24,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
