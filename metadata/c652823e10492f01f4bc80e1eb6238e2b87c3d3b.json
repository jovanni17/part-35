Producer Eddie Wohl, who worked\n  with the band on Consciousness, also manned the board on the new album at his\n  Babyland Studios. The level of comfort with Wohl helped make 3s the\n  consistent, tightly constructed album that it is. He gets us and our sound,\n  Danielsen said. The first single from 3s is Afterlife, a song that is heavy\n  but up-tempo and is representative of the album as whole on both sonic and\n  stylistic levels. The song is generally about getting yourself outta Dodge. I\n  was being tired or frustrated in a situation and having the need to get out of\n  town, Danielsen said, sharing a tiny particle of detail about the song's\n  meaning. Remember, he wants you to decipher things for yourself! Let Go is a\n  another standout and exceptional track on 3s, with Danielsen proclaiming that\n  it's a different sound for us, different than what we've done, and it's a fun\n  song to play. It's about letting go of old ideas or beliefs or whatever, and\n  letting go of the old to allow yourself to be reborn into something new.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
