Scared\n\nHayes is Signe Tollefsen's second full album. It's the successor of the Dutch/American singer/songwriter's critically acclaimed debut and the equally successful (covers) E.P. Baggage. Reviewing the latter, several critics noted that her version of P.J. Harvey's 'Down By The Water' was even better than the origina versionl.\n\nFrom Signe Tollefsen-with-flowers to Signe Tollefsen -with-balls that, in the nutshell, describes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hayes the latest album of Dutch /American and British educated singer-songwriter Signe Tollefsen\n\nThere are traces of her debut CD and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BaggageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ but SigneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound has moved on from acoustic to electric. Whatever changed, what remains the same is: as always, that strong powerful voice, the intensity, the emotion, the song writing. The elements that rightfully made her a winner of 2 awards at the Grand Prix of The Netherlands that made legendary Dutch singer Mathilde Santing record one of her songs and that put her on tour with PavementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Stephen Malkmus amongst others. And that made famous and well-spoken television personality (and ex-football player) Jan Mulder stammer after her live-on-air-performance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“just gorgeousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\n'Hayes' was recorded in (Four None Blondes) Linda PerryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s studio in Los Angeles and the We Are Junkies Studio in Eindhoven Holland. The latter is also the home base of the extremely talented Mindpark , whose Ralph Timmermans co-produced the album with Signe Tollefsen. This duo also plays most of the instruments on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“HayesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/05/signe-tollefsen/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/05/signe-tollefsen/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:675d8431f1e9621c9395b4081419d36aab9af9c7","amp;dn":"Signe+Tollefsen...Hayes%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"675d8431f1e9621c9395b4081419d36aab9af9c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,93,132,49,241,233,98,28,147,149,180,8,20,25,211,106,171,154,249,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
