It is from the album &quot;Five Miles Out&quot; and features vocals by Maggie Reilly.&quot;Five Miles Out&quot; has a complex structure despite its unusual length, and the lyrics are about Oldfield's experience of a near-tragic flight. Reilly sings with a clean voice while Oldfield uses a vocoder most of the time himself. The song features the same guitar riff that appears in the beginning of &quot;Taurus II&quot; and during the intro a keyboard quotes the opening motif to Tubular Bells, a trick that he repeats in later pieces such as &quot;Crises&quot;.\n     &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; is a  song written and performed by Mike Oldfield, released as a single in May 1983 and included in the album &quot;Crises&quot; of the same year.

It is Oldfield's most successful single to date, reaching number one on a number of charts around Europe.The single peaked at number 4 in the British charts, making it Oldfield's second highest ranked single after &quot;Portsmouth&quot;, which reached number 3 in 1976. &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; was successful throughout Europe. It reached number 1 in countries, including Brazil for two weeks, Italy, Austria, Switzerland for four weeks and Norway for six weeks. It spent four weeks at number 2 in Germany and also hit number 6 in Australia. \n     &quot;Shadow on the Wall&quot; is a single by Oldfield, released in 1983.

It is from the album &quot;Discovery&quot;. Maggie Reilly and Barry Palmer perform vocals for this song.The music video for &quot;Tricks of the Light&quot; is a mock-live performance of the song and focuses on a girl in the crowd. There are also additional non-concert scenes of a girl with and without sunglasses. Oldfield plays a Fender Stratocaster in the video and a Fairlight CMI appears on stage.\n     &quot;Flying Start&quot; is a single by Oldfield, released in 1988. &quot;Flying Start&quot; features Kevin Ayers on vocals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94dc0802aeadad32ce2d7b8ed899329a5f2fc623","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+431","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94dc0802aeadad32ce2d7b8ed899329a5f2fc623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,220,8,2,174,173,173,50,206,45,123,142,216,153,50,154,95,47,198,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
