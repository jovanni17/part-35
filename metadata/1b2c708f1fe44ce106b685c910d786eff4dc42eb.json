The Felon's just done five hard years for the State, and now she's back on the street with a simple To-Do List: get a haircut; grab a shower; eat a burger; and, oh yeah, nail the SOBs who took her money and left her to take the fall. It's not about right or wrong-it's all about the crime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b2c708f1fe44ce106b685c910d786eff4dc42eb","amp;dn":"Felon+%2801+-+04%29+%282001+-+2002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b2c708f1fe44ce106b685c910d786eff4dc42eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,44,112,143,31,228,76,225,6,182,133,201,16,215,134,239,244,220,66,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
