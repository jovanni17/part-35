Heavy water, readily available in the oceans, is used in tabletop experiments that yield enormous amounts of heat energy.\n\nAppropriately named &quot;cold fusion&quot;, this purported breakthrough challenges many basic scientific concepts. \n\nIn response, the gatekeepers of &quot;official science&quot;, heavily reliant upon government funding for their hot fusion research, level an unprecedented smear campaign against the entire field of cold fusion science. \n\nWas their discovery of &quot;fire from water&quot; too good to be true ?. Or was it the discovery of the millennium ?. \n\nDuration : 46 minutes.\nSize : 290 MB.\nVideo : Xvid.
