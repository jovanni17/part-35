But there is another part of the story that has remained unrecorded and buried.\nOur Moon Has Blood Clots is the unspoken chapter in the story of Kashmir, in which it was purged of the Kashmiri Pandit community in a violent ethnic cleansing backed by Islamist militants. Hundreds of people were tortured and killed, and about 3,50,000 Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave their homes and spend the rest of their lives in exile in their own country. \nRahul Pandita has written a deeply personal, powerful and unforgettable story of history, home and loss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eefe65fe0f85a9309cb414330c612a78e17355a8","amp;dn":"Rahul+Pandita+-+Our+Moon+has+Blood+Clots_The+Exodus+of+the+Kashm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eefe65fe0f85a9309cb414330c612a78e17355a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,254,101,254,15,133,169,48,156,180,20,51,12,97,42,120,225,115,85,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
