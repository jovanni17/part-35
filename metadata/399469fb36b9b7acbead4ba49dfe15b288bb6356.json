Sonic purity at it's finest Nobody sounds like Poobah. All these CD's are great! One of the few bands I still listen to from my teen years. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1 of 1 people found the following review helpful\n5.0 out of 5 stars Poobah strikes again! Great Cd 9 Nov 2009 \n\nBy Guitarfan - Published on Amazon.com\n\nAfter an absence ,Poobah comes back with another fantastic Cd.This is a long album ,78 minutes.Highway Gestapo is one killer song,but, all the songs are good.That is rare these days,with so much filler on the Cds you buy.This display of guitar fireworks, and good songwriting is well worth your time.I love the lyrics, too. This album will &quot;take you places&quot; if you know what I mean.\nI love Jim Gustafson on guitar. The man knows how to rock, and fills this Cd with great guitar.His singing is very good, too, and he always seems to write such good material.I think all rock music fans will love this excellent Cd.When I visited the bands site, I saw around 10 Cds by these guys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:399469fb36b9b7acbead4ba49dfe15b288bb6356","amp;dn":"Poobah+-+Wizard+Of+Psych+%5B1998%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"399469fb36b9b7acbead4ba49dfe15b288bb6356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,148,105,251,54,185,183,172,190,173,75,164,157,254,21,178,136,187,99,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
