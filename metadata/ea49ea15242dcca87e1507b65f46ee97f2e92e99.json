Roger Trigaux (member of U.Z. till their second album) founded his own ensemble to unfold his musical visions. Not far away from U.Z.'s style Present carries on the dark and somber sounds in terms of '1313' or 'Heresie' but more directly and electrified. Their sinister work often arouses goosebumps.\nWhen you're familiar with the musical explorations of U.Z., do not hesitate and give Present a try. You won't be disappointed.\n\nAlbums:\n\n1980 - Triskaidekaphobie\n1985 - Le Poison Qui Rend Fou\n1993 - C.O.D.
