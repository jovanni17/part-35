Some of the tunes might be familiar ones from Chet's book, but the performances here are often distinctly un-Baker-like -- taken at times, tempos, and tones that really push the envelope -- and which make the album more of a demonstration of the instrumental strengths of Rava and Fresu than a return to Chet's earlier sound. Each player gets a channel of the recording to himself -- in a way that makes for very playful interchange that recalls the way Chet's horn and the baritone of Gerry Mulligan worked together strongly on Pacific Jazz -- save for the fact that this time, neither player's working on a reed instrument. Rhythm is by the trio of Stefano Bollani piano, Enzo Pietropaoli bass, and Roberto Gatto drums -- and titles include &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;, &quot;Anthropology&quot;, &quot;Doxy&quot;, &quot;Line For Lyons&quot;, &quot;Donna&quot;, &quot;You Can't Go Home Again&quot;, and &quot;Strike Up The Band&quot; &quot;\n\nPersonnel:\nEnrico Rava (trumpet, flugelhorn);\nPaolo Fresu (trombone);\nStefano Bollani (piano);\nEnzo Pietropaoli (bass);\nRoberto Gatto (drums)\n\nEnrico Rava and Paolo Fresu - Shades of Chet Tracks:\n01  Doodlin'\n02  My Funny Valentine\n03  Anthropology\n04  Retrato Em Branco E Preto\n05  Doxy\n06  You Can't Go Home Again\n07  Line For Lyons\n08  Strike Up The Band\n09  Donna","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0e67201cfd14c921f6fef70cecd1d728c0cf75","amp;dn":"Enrico+Rava+and+Paolo+Fresu+-+Shades+of+Chet+%281999%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf0e67201cfd14c921f6fef70cecd1d728c0cf75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,14,103,32,28,253,20,201,33,246,254,247,12,236,209,215,40,192,207,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
