I've added two other must-have Tool track mods\nas well...\n\n\n\nTool tracks mods:\n=================\nTool - 10,000 Days--Viginti Tres--Wings for Marie (sync).mp3\nTool - 10,000 Days--Viginti Tres--Wings for Marie (sync, outro pan).mp3 *\n\n\tWith the below noted cues points, the &quot;guitar climax&quot; at 9:14 sync \n\tperfectly. There is unavoidable drift though, evident in the drums \n\ton the tail end of this guitar riff. \n\n\t\tCues: \t\n\t\t-----\n\t\t10,000 Days (wings part 2) \t0:00\n\t\tViginti Tres\t\t\t0:00\n\t\tWings for Marie (part 1)\t5:01.350 **\n\n\n\t\t&quot;Guitar climax&quot; start sync points: \n\t\t----------------------------------\t\t\n\t\t10,000 Days:\t\t\t9:14.168\n\t\tWings for Marie:\t\t4:12.818\n\n\n\t* I supplied a slightly panned version for the masses as well.  \n\tIn this version, once the heavy guitar climax ends at 9:30, \n\tI gradually (over 2s) panned them to 20% left and 20% right for \n\t10,000 Days and Wings, respectively. They retain most of their original\n\tstereo, but you get a slighty better stereo effect to the sync at the end.\n\n\t** Start Wings at 0:00.974 before Viginti Tres ends. Though start \n\tcues are more accurate. This value merely indicates that you \n\tcannot simply start Wings once Viginti ends. \n\n\n\nTool - Faaip de Oiad--Lost Keys (overlay).mp3\n\n\tFaaip de Oiad \t(Lateralus 2001)\n\tLost Keys \t(10,000 Days 2006)\n\n\tThese tracks, oddly enough, work perfectly together.  \n\tPerhaps it's no coincidence at all, given the previous example.\n\n\n\nTool - Parabol--Parabola.mp3\n\n\tI put these two together just because they belong that way!  \n\tDamned random/shuffle kills these two tracks.\n\n\n\nTools:\n======\nAdobe Audition 3.0\tmultitrack editor for precise syncing, overlays, merge \nGoldwave 5.23\t\tfinalization, fade in/out (minor), check for clipping...etc\ndBpowerAMP 11.6\t\tFLAC -&gt; WAV, WAV -&gt; MP3\nMediaMonkey 3.1\t\ttrack volume analysis -&gt; to tags only \n\t\t\t(for players that can level playback)\n\n\n\nAudio quality:\n=============\nFLAC\t44.100Hz 16bit stereo\nWAV\t44.100Hz 16bit stereo\nMP3\t320kbps CBR MP3 LAME 3.96r \n\n\n\nLineage:\n========\nFLAC -&gt; WAV -&gt; Audition -&gt; WAV -&gt; Goldwave -&gt; dBpowerAMP -&gt; MP3 -&gt; MediaMonkey","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c615cd868dd11152ab8683706e8f879738189f5f","amp;dn":"Tool+-+10%2C000+Days+--+Viginti+Tres+--+Wings+for+Marie+--+SYNC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c615cd868dd11152ab8683706e8f879738189f5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,21,205,134,141,209,17,82,171,134,131,112,110,143,135,151,56,24,159,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
