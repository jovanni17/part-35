Daly's earlier work has been described as &quot;Tintin meets the Freak Brothers in the Cape of Good Dope.&quot; Indeed, Daly's cartoons, offbeat, hallucinatory, and often hilarious, seem descended from and in some cases an amalgamation of the substance-induced work of Robert Crumb, Gilbert Shelton, Victor Moscoso, and S. Clay Wilson, filtered through the artist's own unique vision and sense of the absurd. Stories alternate between full color and black-and-white and range from representational Jim Jarmusch-like scenarios to wild visual excursions, albeit linear ones. We are pleased to introduce a unique new voice to the world of cartooning and predict Daly's mix of deadpan absurdity and surreal imagery will be greeted with enthusiasm by readers and critics alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd54e6e75bfaa475f55a9d86182eb9a9e218f396","amp;dn":"Scrublands_%282006%29_%28digital%29_%28Minutemen-InnerPhDemons%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd54e6e75bfaa475f55a9d86182eb9a9e218f396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,84,230,231,91,250,164,117,245,90,157,134,24,46,185,169,226,24,243,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
