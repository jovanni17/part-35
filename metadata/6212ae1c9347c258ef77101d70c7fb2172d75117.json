Once in the 80Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s he joined a band called No Smoking Orchestra. He made one record with them then left. Later the band split into two parts. One part stayed in Bosnia and one left for Belgrade. While working on his movies he asked the Belgrade version to do the music for it and since they lacked a bass player he jumped in. This are the three records with music from and based on his films. Also as always you lot get a bonus. A live record from Buenos Aries. Hope you like gypsy music because this rocks.\n\nBlack Cat, White Cat\n\nLife Is a Miracle\n\nUnza Unza Time\n\nLive from Buenos Aires 2001","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6212ae1c9347c258ef77101d70c7fb2172d75117","amp;dn":"Emir+Kusturica+%26+The+No+Smoking+Orchestra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6212ae1c9347c258ef77101d70c7fb2172d75117","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,18,174,28,147,71,194,88,239,119,16,29,112,199,251,33,114,215,81,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
