The original line-up consisted of the singer Mike Huhmann, drummer Christoph SchellÃƒÂ¶h and the two guitar-players Oliver Eikenberg and Philipp Hanfland. Bass-player Ulrich Busch joined the band several months later. Together with him the band recorded their first demo-tape Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Duet Of ThoughtsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in spring Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ96.\n\nWith a first musical sign of life, Burden of Grief entered the stages of the underground-clubs for the first time. Spurred on by the positive reactions so far, the band decided to enter the Stage One Studio to record their next album together with producer Andy Classen. As a result 5 songs came out which had been released as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Above Twilight WingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-MCD. The reactions and reviews to this CD were absolutely great. Even the metal magazine Rock Hard recognized the huge development of Burden of GriefÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music and selected the band for their newcomer compilation CD Ã¢â‚¬Å“UnerhÃƒÂ¶rt-the best of the unsigned actsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe band played one gig after another and developed to become an impressing live act. Nearly two years after the release of their debut-MCD, Burden of Grief entered the studio again (this time the Ofen-studio in Kassel) to record their next album together with producer Carsten Schmerer who joined the band some months later as their drummer. Besides four new songs and the re-recorded demo-song the CD should contain the old Iron Maiden classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“ProwlerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\n2000 - Haunting Requiems\n\n2001 - On Darker Trails\n\n2004 - Fields of Salvation\n\n2007 - Death End Road\n\n2010 - Follow The Flames\n\n2014 - Unchained","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32715437ebe5d5b738bdff65dffa3d8c120b6547","amp;dn":"Burden+Of+Grief-Unchained+320k+++mp3+++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32715437ebe5d5b738bdff65dffa3d8c120b6547","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,113,84,55,235,229,213,183,56,189,255,101,223,250,61,140,18,11,101,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
