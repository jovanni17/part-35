Paul Joseph Watson uses mainstream media reports to exhaustively document how governments are exploiting and even carrying out terrorist attacks to further their unified political agenda. Every referenced article is available online so you can cross-check the facts for yourself!\r\n\r\nWatson goes back in history to show how the same tactics used to centralize power and coerce societies are still being used today. A high-tech prison grid police state is being erected that will envelop everyone on planet earth in a spider web of brutal tyranny.\r\n\r\nNo longer is the New World Order a shadowy enemy lurking on the horizon, it is in our faces and the proof is everywhere. The dark empire of world government is in the final stages of its construction. This book is one of many keys you will need to unlock the door and shine the burning light of freedom upon the twisted souls of the Globalists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:682f25e6c838c34b1eaca7ca6067acbe696b12e6","amp;dn":"Order+Out+of+Chaos+By+Paul+Joseph+Watson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"682f25e6c838c34b1eaca7ca6067acbe696b12e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,47,37,230,200,56,195,75,30,172,167,202,96,103,172,190,105,107,18,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
