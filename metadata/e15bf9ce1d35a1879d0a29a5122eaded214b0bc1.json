With previous projects ranging from the political cabaret of the CitizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Band to the garage punk tantrums of Mildred and the Mice, Elson has her share of musical experience, but with such wide-ranging credits, it was anyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guess what her own album would sound like. On The Ghost Who Walks, she runs the gamut from chilly murder ballads with British roots to Nashville twang, giving old-timey folk and modern rock the same intensity and singing of shipwrecks, stolen lovers, and storms with a beguiling mournfulness. Her voiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dark dreaminess carries the album, especially on more stripped-down tracks like the acoustic late-summer lament ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLunasaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the ghostly shanty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStolen Roses.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Though the album is Elson's showcase, White produced it, and his touches are everywhere. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Truth Is in the DirtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s earthy, apocalyptic feel gets added heft from sudden dynamic shifts and spooky organ and pedal steel that recall his work with the Dead Weather -- and indeed, White's bandmate Jack Lawrence plays here as well, underscoring the repertory company vibe of projects White is associated with. His fondness for theatricality and Elson's cabaret roots combine on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ100 Years from Now,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a lovelorn song that starts off sounding like itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s being played on a wax cylinder, then blooms into a sweeping waltz complete with theremin, and on the dust bowl ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMouths to Feed.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Yet many of the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most striking moments are decidedly modern-sounding: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Ghost Who WalksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- which gets its name from one of the epithets Elson was called in school because she was so pale -- updates the murder ballad tradition with electric pianos that rain unearthly beauty onto the song; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Thief at My DoorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ebbs and flows, dipping into darker rock territory; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Last LaughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½'s gentle country-pop sounds like it could have come off a long-lost Dolly Parton album from the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s. While The Ghost Who Walks occasionally feels a little long and scattered, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still a beautifully made album that earns Elson a place among moody songstresses such as Neko Case, Amanda Palmer, Hope Sandoval, and Paula Frazer.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/06/02/karen-elson/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e15bf9ce1d35a1879d0a29a5122eaded214b0bc1","amp;dn":"Karen+Elson...The+Ghost+Who+Walks+%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e15bf9ce1d35a1879d0a29a5122eaded214b0bc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,91,249,206,29,53,161,135,157,10,41,165,18,46,173,237,33,75,11,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
