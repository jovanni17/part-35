However, it is important, nonetheless, that all can appreciate this band's complete works, as well. Mayday Parade is a fantastic band, with an even more fantastic secondary vocalist, Mr. Jeremy Lenzo. The only reason Jeremy isn't the lead singer of Mayday Parade is because if he was singing all throughout every song, your head would explode from the shouting goodness. Honestly, though, they're wonderful on tour, and I recommend you go see them when they get back on, after they finish their contribution to Punk Goes Pop, Vol. 2 with a cover of The Pussycat Dolls' &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;. Hilarious, I know. Seed away, folks.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n A Lesson in Romantics\n  (Released: 2007. Compression: FLAC Lossless.)\n   1. Jamie All Over\n   2. Black Cat\n   3.
