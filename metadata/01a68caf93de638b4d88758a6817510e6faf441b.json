The lyrics refer to a person leaving a small town to try and succeed in New York City (&quot;I left a small town for the apple in decay&quot;) and the loneliness he feels there. The song features a clavinet and was co-written by Mick Jones, Lou Gramm &amp; former member of King Crimson, Ian McDonald. The single was released in November 1977. It reached number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978.\n\n\nForeigner are a British-American rock band, originally formed in 1976 by veteran English musicians Mick Jones, ex-King Crimson member Ian McDonald along with American vocalist Lou Gramm. Foreigner have sold more than 70 million albums worldwide (including over 37.5 million in the United States alone).\n\nSince its inception, Foreigner has been led by English musician Mick Jones (former member of Nero and the Gladiators, Spooky Tooth and The Leslie West Band) who, in early 1976, met with ex-King Crimson member Ian McDonald and formed Foreigner with Lou Gramm (ex-Black Sheep), Dennis Elliott, Al Greenwood, and Ed Gagliardi as a sextet. Jones came up with the name from the fact that no matter what country they were in, three would be foreigners, because he, McDonald, and Elliott were English, while Gramm, Greenwood, and Gagliardi were Americans. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long,_Long_Way_from_Home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long,_Long_Way_from_Home&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HacBOaaGE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HacBOaaGE&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 7308kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps    \n   Duration: 00:02:55\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
