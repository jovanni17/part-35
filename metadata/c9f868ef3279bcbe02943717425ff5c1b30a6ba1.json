Survivors of slave labour, brainwashing, torture and attempted organ harvesting combine with eminent experts, and an investigative journalist, to deliberate on this contentious subject that increasingly involves the West.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1519434/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1519434/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Harrowing, disturbing, brutal, shocking, disgusting.\n\nShows how financial greed and power makes influential people turn a blind eye to justice and protection of human rights even in the UK. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a quote I heard when I was little that I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fully remember, but it was roughly along the lines of: the man holding the coat of the person beating a man to death is just as guilty of murder as the man doing the beating. Think its pretty apt in regards to global powers turning a blind eye and allowing the atrocity to continue.  Pretty sickening. A waiting time of 1-2 weeks for an organ transplant is horrific when you learn why the waiting time is so short. They have turned people into pigs for slaughter. Its one step away from cultivating humans simply for organ harvesting.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Anonymous\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.transmission610.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.transmission610.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDB RATING: 8.4\n\n   [FORMAT]:.......................[ DivX\n   [GENRE]:........................[ Documentary\n   [FILE SIZE]:....................[ 1257 MB\n   [RESOLUTION]:...................[ 720*400\n   [VIDEO BITRATE]:................[ 1299 Kbps\n   [FRAME RATE]:...................[ 25.00 fps\n   [LANGUAGE ]:....................[ English\n   [RUNTIME]:......................[ 2h 03mn\n   [AUDIO BITRATE]:................[ 128 Kbps\n   [SAMPLING RATE]:................[ 44.1 KHz\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Shocking to find out about the torture of Falun Gong members that has been going on in China for years, and yet in the Western world so many people would have absolutely no idea about it. If the UK government treated itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s people like this there would be an international outcry. This film will help raise awareness of the issues and hopefully contribute to ending this awful persecution.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Joanna Chesworth, Conservation Officer, Hampshire UK\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Exposed a lot.
