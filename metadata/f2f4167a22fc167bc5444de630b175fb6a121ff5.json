A. Konrath &amp; Jack Kilborn \n\nAfraid, Trapped &amp; Endurance    (epub)\n\n\nA F R A I D - A Novel of Terror\n\nWELCOME TO SAFE HAVEN, POPULATION 907...\n\nNestled in the woods of Wisconsin, Safe Haven is miles from everything. With one road in and out, this is a town so peaceful it has never needed a full-time police force. Until now...\n\nA helicopter has crashed on the outskirts of town and something terrible has been unleashed. A classified secret weapon programmed to kill anything that stands in its way. Now it's headed for the nearest lights to do what it does best. Isolate. Terrorize. Annihilate.\n\nSoon all phone lines are dead and the road is blocked. Safe HavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only chance for survival rests on the shoulders of an aging county sheriff. And as the body count rises, the sheriff realizes something even more terrifying - maybe death hasn't come to his little town by accident...\n\nWELCOME TO SAFE HAVEN, POPULATION 907... 906... 905...\n\nAFRAID by Jack Kilborn\nAre you afraid of the dark? You will be.\n\n\nT R A P P E D - A Novel of Terror\n\nTERRIFIED...\n\nIt was supposed to be a harmless camping trip. Six wayward teenagers who'd run into trouble with the law, and their court-appointed guardians, Sara and Martin Randhurst. Three nights on a small, deserted island off of Michigan's upper peninsula. A time to bond, to learn, to heal.\n\nThen Martin told a campfire story about the island's history. Of the old civil war prison hidden in there, and the starving confederate soldiers who resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. Everyone thought it was funny. They even laughed when Martin pretended to be dragged off into the woods.\n\nBut Martin didn't come back. And neither did Sara when she went in search of him.\n\nThen the laughter stopped.\n\n...TO DEATH\n\nThe group soon began to realize that this deserted island wasn't so deserted after all. And perhaps Martin's ridiculous story had more truth to it than anyone thought.\n\nWhat's the most horrifying thing you can imagine?\n\nThis is a hundred times worse...\n\nTRAPPED by Jack Kilborn\nIt starts where other horror ends \n\n\nE N D U R A N C E - A Novel of Terror\n\nWELCOME TO THE RUSHMORE INN\n\nThe bed and breakfast was hidden in the hills of West Virginia. Wary guests wondered how it could stay in business at such a creepy, remote location. Especially with its bizarre, presidential decor and eccentric proprietor.\n\nONCE YOU CHECK IN...\n\nWhen the event hotel for the national Iron Woman triathlon accidentally overbooked, competitor Maria was forced to stay at the Rushmore. But after checking into her room, she quickly realized she wasn't alone. First her suitcase wasn't where she put it. Then her cell phone was moved. Finally, she heard an odd creaking under the bed. Confusion quickly turned to fear, and fear to hysteria when she discovered the front door was barred and the windows were bricked over. There was no way out.\n\n...YOU'LL BE DYING TO LEAVE\n\nOne year later, four new female athletes have become guests of the Inn. Will they escape the horrors within its walls? Or will they join the many others who have died there, in ways too terrible to imagine?\n\nENDURANCE by Jack Kilborn\nAre you brave enough to finish?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2f4167a22fc167bc5444de630b175fb6a121ff5","amp;dn":"Jack+Kilborn+Trilogy+-+J.+A.+Konrath+%26amp%3B+Jack+Kilborn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2f4167a22fc167bc5444de630b175fb6a121ff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,244,22,122,34,252,22,123,197,68,77,230,48,177,117,251,106,18,31,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
