Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as Baby Bink's parents; especially the three enterprising kidnapers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. Successfully kidnaping Baby Bink, they have a harder time keeping hold of the rascal, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than the three bumbling criminals. \n\nDirected by Patrick Read Johnson. \n\nStarring Lara Flynn Boyle, Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano.
