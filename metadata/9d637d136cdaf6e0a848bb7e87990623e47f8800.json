Find out in this red-hot prequel novella to The Mighty Quinns: Dex!\n\nIan Stephens is every inch the respectful English historian--right down to his houndstooth jacket. Yet Claire Kennedy was expecting her new research partner for author Aileen Quinn's documentary to be...well, old. Certainly not a gorgeous academic who sends Claire's libido through the roof! But Claire is strictly &quot;shag 'em and leave 'em,&quot; and Ian has commitment written all over him.\n\nIan is trying to be a gentleman, but something about Claire invites sweet, delicious sin. Even if it's completely unprofessional, the connection between them is magnetic. But the more they try to prove that it's just sexual chemistry, the more Ian realizes he's found the one thing that can't be catalogued and shelved--love. How can he convince Claire that the sweetest seduction lasts a lifetime?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d637d136cdaf6e0a848bb7e87990623e47f8800","amp;dn":"Kate+Hoffmann+-+A+Mighty+Quinn+Seduction+%5BEPUB+%26amp%3B+MOBI%5D+%7B+KT+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d637d136cdaf6e0a848bb7e87990623e47f8800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,99,125,19,108,218,246,224,168,72,187,126,135,153,6,35,228,127,136,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
