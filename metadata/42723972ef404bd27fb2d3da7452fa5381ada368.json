In addition to this tutorial, new results are presented with respect to Schur-convex functions and regarding the properties of matrix-monotone functions. The approach taken by the authors provides a valuable overview of the basic techniques for readers who are new to the subject. They then proceed to show in separate chapters the cutting edge applications of the two basic theories in wireless communications Majorization Theory and Matrix-Monotone Functions in Wireless Communications is an invaluable resource for students, researchers and practitioners involved in the state-of-the-art design of wireless communication systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42723972ef404bd27fb2d3da7452fa5381ada368","amp;dn":"Majorization+and+Matrix+Monotone+Functions+in+Wireless+Communica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42723972ef404bd27fb2d3da7452fa5381ada368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,114,57,114,239,64,75,210,127,178,211,218,116,82,250,83,129,173,163,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
