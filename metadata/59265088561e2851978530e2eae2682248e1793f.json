The fifteen tracks include a wide variety of songs that continue to show \noff Satch's unique blend of technique and tasty melodies.\n Although Satriani's 1995 self-titled release was a more organic departure\n from the normal way Satriani creates his music,\n it wasn't as satisfying as his previous studio work.\n  With &quot;Crystal Planet,&quot; Satriani returns to a more calculated setting by\n literally &quot;cutting and pasting&quot; the best of his new studio work together.\n You might argue with the methods, but you cannot argue with the results.\n &quot;Crystal Planet&quot; Satriani returns to form and raises the bar on some occasions.\n\nContinuing his tradition of &quot;surfing&quot; songs,\n Satriani has a solid workout with tunes such as &quot;Ceremony&quot; and the\n Grammy-nominated &quot;A Train Of Angels&quot;.\n While there are no outright ballads in the vein of his\n classic &quot;Always With You, Always With Me&quot; there are lovely little pieces such as\n the spirited echoes of &quot;Love Thing&quot; and nearly understated &quot;Z.Z.'s Song.&quot;\n\nHighlights on the disc include &quot;Raspberry Jam Delta-V&quot; and &quot;With Jupiter And Mind&quot; when\n Satriani really stretches out with some new ideas and great tone.\n Satriani also revisits some interesting arrangements and juxtapositions\n on &quot;Time&quot; which has an apocalyptic feel to it.\n These tunes engage the listener in a journey of musical\n ideas that very few artists even dare try.\n\nSatriani is supported by the ever-great bass playing of Stu Hamm and solid,\n if unspectacular, drumming of Jeff Campitelli.\n Also, assisting on the disc are Eric Caudieux contributing\n keys and programming as well as Eric Valentine in a variety of roles.\n Producer Mike Fraser, who has worked with the likes of Aerosmith and Metallica,\n does a great job of keeping a balance between the big\n rock sounds of &quot;The Extremist&quot; and the eclectic stylings of &quot;Surfing With The Alien.&quot;\n\nAll in all, this disc is a return to the high standards fans have come to\n expect from Satriani.\n Check out Joe Satriani's official website at http://www.satriani.com/ for more information.\n\n\n\n \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy our releases and help us with sharing, please.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeak level 100.0 %\n     Range quality 100.0 %\n     Test CRC E95DFC38\n     Copy CRC E95DFC38\n     Copy OK\n\nNo errors occurred\n\n \nAccurateRip summary\n \nTrack  1  accurately ripped (confidence 60)  [B96E693F]\nTrack  2  accurately ripped (confidence 58)  [D3AD3337]\nTrack  3  accurately ripped (confidence 58)  [D6D28E2F]\nTrack  4  accurately ripped (confidence 59)  [9C705890]\nTrack  5  accurately ripped (confidence 60)  [78310BE2]\nTrack  6  accurately ripped (confidence 59)  [B2E2BE5C]\nTrack  7  accurately ripped (confidence 60)  [8FAB5429]\nTrack  8  accurately ripped (confidence 60)  [7FEA1C9F]\nTrack  9  accurately ripped (confidence 58)  [C768A040]\nTrack 10  accurately ripped (confidence 59)  [97557663]\nTrack 11  accurately ripped (confidence 58)  [DF16AFF2]\nTrack 12  accurately ripped (confidence 59)  [2AA8F912]\nTrack 13  accurately ripped (confidence 58)  [26CCB4E8]\nTrack 14  accurately ripped (confidence 58)  [B8431BF3]\nTrack 15  accurately ripped (confidence 55)  [256AA9A9]\n \nAll tracks accurately ripped","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59265088561e2851978530e2eae2682248e1793f","amp;dn":"Joe+Satriani+-+Crystal+Planet+%281998%29%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BRock+City%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59265088561e2851978530e2eae2682248e1793f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,38,80,136,86,30,40,81,151,133,48,226,234,226,104,34,72,225,121,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
