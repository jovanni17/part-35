In the fifth programme of    \n    the series, archaeologist and historian Richard Miles     \n    examines the phenomenon of the Roman Republic, from its    \n    fratricidal mythical beginnings, with the legend of       \n    Romulus and Remus, to the all too real violence of its   \n    end, dragged to destruction by war lords like Pompey      \n    the Great and Julius Caesar.                               \n                                                              \n    Travelling to Sicily and North Africa, Richard tells     \n    the story of Rome's century-long struggle for dominance   \n    with the other great regional power, Carthage. It was a    \n    struggle that would end with the total destruction of     \n    this formidable enemy and the transformation of          \n    landlubber Rome into a seapower, and the Republic into    \n    an Empire. But with no-one left to beat, the only enemy    \n    that Rome had left was itself.                            \n                                                             \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd76fcf3b3ced495691676946e3772d030be185a","amp;dn":"Ancient.Worlds.S01E05.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd76fcf3b3ced495691676946e3772d030be185a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,118,252,243,179,206,212,149,105,22,118,148,110,55,114,208,48,190,24,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
