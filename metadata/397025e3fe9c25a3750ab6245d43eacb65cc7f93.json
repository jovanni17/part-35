He's been there four and a half years now and is looking forward to the return of the supply ship and the goods it may have for him. When it arrives, Captain Allenby has something of a surprise for him: a female robot companion by the name of Alicia. She is human-like in every way but Corry can't but see her as a machine. He comes around however but they won't live happily ever after.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:397025e3fe9c25a3750ab6245d43eacb65cc7f93","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Lonely","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"397025e3fe9c25a3750ab6245d43eacb65cc7f93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,112,37,227,254,156,37,163,117,10,182,36,93,67,234,203,101,204,127,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
