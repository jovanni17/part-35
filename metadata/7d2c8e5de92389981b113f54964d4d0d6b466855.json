A Cosmic Parent\n\nThis album sees Boxcutter ditching the computer sequencing and using lots of analogue synths, delays and guitar pedals to give an organic texture to the record. 'Arecibo Message' features more guitars and bass than previous records and influences such as Hendrix as well as 2 step Garage influences such as Wideboys are clear.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d2c8e5de92389981b113f54964d4d0d6b466855","amp;dn":"Boxcutter+-+Arecibo+Message+%282009%29+%5Bdubstep%2Felectronica%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d2c8e5de92389981b113f54964d4d0d6b466855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,44,142,93,233,35,137,152,27,17,63,84,150,77,77,13,107,70,104,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
