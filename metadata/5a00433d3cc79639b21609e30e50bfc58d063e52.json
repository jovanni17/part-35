The artist's incendiary early shows in front of raucous surfer crowds at Balboa Beach's Rendezvous Ballroom established Dale as a regional sensation, and in the process helped to put surf music on the map. After he became an international star, Dale and his longstanding band the Del-Tones maintained the energy and innovation of their early performances, expanding their reputation as a peerless live act. \n\nIn 1965, Dale captured the infectious spirit of his live shows with this album, recorded on stage at the fabled Hollywood nightclub Ciro's. This vintage LP offers a bracing snapshot of the trailblazing guitar hero at his string-shredding best, tearing into his classic &quot;Let's Go Trippin',&quot; and applying his head-spinning instrumental fire to such diverse tunes as Henry Mancini's &quot;Peter Gunn,&quot; Lee Hazlewood's &quot;Angry Generation&quot; and Bob Dylan's &quot;Blowin' in the Wind.&quot; He also unveils his underrated vocal skills on riveting readings of Eddie Cochran's &quot;Summertime Blues,&quot; Barrett Strong's &quot;Money&quot; and Ray Charles' &quot;What'd I Say.&quot; \n\nOut of print on vinyl for decades, the Sundazed edition of Rock Out with Dick Dale and His Del-Tones (Live at Ciro's) has been mastered from the original analog tapes with completely restored original cover art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a00433d3cc79639b21609e30e50bfc58d063e52","amp;dn":"Dick+Dale+%26amp%3B+His+Del-Tones+-+Live+At+Ciro%27s+%281965%29+%7BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a00433d3cc79639b21609e30e50bfc58d063e52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,0,67,61,60,199,150,57,178,22,9,227,14,80,191,197,141,6,62,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
