That album, in turn, was drawn from several previous Ives albums, the 1952 set Christmas Day in the Morning, Christmas Eve (1956), Have a Holly Jolly Christmas (1965), and the TV soundtrack Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1966). Ives came to be closely associated with Christmas when he served as narrator for the animated TV special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer in 1964 and scored a hit with the then-newly written &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas.&quot; But his earlier seasonal recordings had been of a more folk-ish and traditional cast, particularly on the Christmas Eve LP. Appropriately, his Have a Holly Jolly Christmas LP contained cheerier, more pop-oriented fare, and by combining four tracks from the former and seven from the latter with a few other selections, compiler Laura Graven achieves a good blend of different kinds of material. Ives' appealing tenor is what holds it together, however, as he performs the songs with warmth and enthusiasm.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60c24cf9f64bc9b9f141d78f7da40586738e8dd2","amp;dn":"20th+Century+Masters%3A+Best+of+Burl+Ives.+The+Christmas+Collectio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60c24cf9f64bc9b9f141d78f7da40586738e8dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,194,76,249,246,75,201,185,241,65,215,143,125,164,5,134,115,142,141,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
