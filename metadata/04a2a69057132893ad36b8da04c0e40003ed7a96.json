Some of the riffs like in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crawling In SecrecyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are unmatchable. The slight atmospheric feel elevates the music like no other, and the vocals of Bernd Reiners are of typical growling Death Metal vocals, though just ordinary work just fine for Ã¢â‚¬Å“RavenousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. If you give more concentration while listening you will realise that this is not one of those unidirectional mindless strangling of the instruments, there are some good catchy riffs and the bass adds the required juice to the album1. \tRavenous \t04:53 \t \n2. \tCrawling in Secrecy \t05:32 \t \n3. \tAbyss of Nameless Fear \t04:24 \t \n4. \tAve Satanas (Acheron cover) \t03:42 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a2a69057132893ad36b8da04c0e40003ed7a96","amp;dn":"Slaughterday+-+Ravenous+%28EP%29+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04a2a69057132893ad36b8da04c0e40003ed7a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,162,166,144,87,19,40,147,173,54,184,218,4,192,228,0,3,237,122,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
