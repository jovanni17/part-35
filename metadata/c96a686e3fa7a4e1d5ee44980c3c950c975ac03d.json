Notes are added from synths, guitar, voice and clarinet and over time, they built into grand, atmospheric soundscapes.\n\nSometimes, however, I forget to press record when something wonderful is created. On these occasions, I can only capture the loop that has already been created. This is the reason that three of the tracks on this album are unusually short.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bingsatellites.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bingsatellites.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c96a686e3fa7a4e1d5ee44980c3c950c975ac03d","amp;dn":"Bing+Satellites+-+Twilight+Sessions+Vol.6+%5Blive+ambient%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c96a686e3fa7a4e1d5ee44980c3c950c975ac03d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,106,104,110,63,167,164,225,213,238,68,152,12,60,149,12,151,90,192,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
