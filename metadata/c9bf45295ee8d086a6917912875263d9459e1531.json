Feeling the end of his relationship with MÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric, his young lover, William spends two days camping with him, taking advantage of the situation by filming the trip and their time spent with another young gay couple. The camera never stops shooting, even when MÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric decides to get it on with another guy in a tent. As Canada's first Dogme95 film, the story is shot on location, with natural lighting and live sound, the camera is hand-held and all superficial elements are forbidden. Yet somehow, in spite of these harsh restrictions during the film-making process, the result is warm and beautiful.\n\n\nNO English sub!\n\n\n00:50:52\n640x480\n25 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9bf45295ee8d086a6917912875263d9459e1531","amp;dn":"2005+Lonely+Child+%28CAN%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9bf45295ee8d086a6917912875263d9459e1531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,191,69,41,94,232,208,134,166,145,121,18,135,82,99,217,69,158,21,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
