Some of them were better than others. Some bands that scored big label contracts werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily better than some of the underground bands. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always felt that Wrath were one of those bands that deserved more recognition than they received. They play a classic &quot;Bay-Area&quot; Thrash Metal style, though they are actually from Chicago, IL. They were somewhat technical, which became the standard for thrash metal and the new death metal scene by the early 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. The overall album is fast and energetic without completely forsaking hooks and musicianship, with the exception of &quot;Bones&quot; which is a slower, heavy instrumental number. Wrath's vocalist Gary Golwitzer has a gnarly, shrill, raw style that reminds me slightly of Cirith Ungol. He has one of those &quot;love Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem or hate Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem&quot; voices. Personally I like his vocals and think they fit the band well. The band also incorporates some classic Maiden-inspired dual guitar parts, such as the solo in &quot;WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Your Name&quot;. Actually, the opening riff of this song is also very NWOBHM inspired.\n\n&quot;Fit of Anger&quot; was originally released on a small independent label and later reissued in 1988 by Medussa Records. According to what I have read of these pressings, the two pressings are nearly identical except for the fact that &quot;In the Wake&quot; and &quot;Fanatics&quot; were remixed for the Medussa Records version. The cassette and CD pressings on Medussa also featured a demo bonus track.\n\n[Note: This upload is from the 2013 Mutants 2cd/dvd release]\n\nDescription from No Life 'Til Metal\n\nAlso Amazon.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16a5a23c7dd81add4ea17ed7b114022be92570f","amp;dn":"Wrath++%5B1986%5D%5Bmp3-320%5D_infx222","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16a5a23c7dd81add4ea17ed7b114022be92570f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,106,90,35,199,221,129,173,212,234,23,237,123,17,64,34,190,146,87,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
