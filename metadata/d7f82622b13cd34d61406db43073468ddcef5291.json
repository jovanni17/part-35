Burn or mount using deamon tools lite for example or any other software of your choice.\n2- Run Install.exe but do not install in the default folder if you intend to use mods, it seams this gives the game some problems. Any other folder or drive is ok.\n3- Copy the whole content from crack folder to your install folder. ex: c:skyrim\n4- Start the game with skyrimLauncher.exe\n\nIf you managed to run the game at this point and you think everything is working fine, quit the game.\n\n- Extract the contents from update 13 rar directly to your skyrim installation folder, this will update the game the latest version.\n\n- Run the game again. Start a new game, wait 1 or 2 minutes for the carriage scene to show up and press ESC, this will bring the options menu and in the left lower corner you should see the version of the game 1.9.32.0.8, if it's not then you did something wrong. This is the process I use to install my game and everything works.\n\n- Extract the DLC rar into your skyrimdata folder. ex: C:skyrimdata\n- Extract the official HD resolution pack into the same folder. Skyrimdata\n\nStart the SkyrimLauncher.exe and click on data files in the menu, a small window should pop up and you should see all the files from the DLC's and the HD textures. If they are not ticked just click the small squares and click them all\n\nThe load order must have the HD texture files loaded after the DLC files in the correct number order.\n\nIf everything went well, your game is fully installed, cracked, updated with the last version and runing all the DLC's and the HD textures.\nYou are now ready to mod your game if you want, since most mods need the game to be in the last version and have all the DLC's.\n\nAll files compressed with 7Zip.\n\n\nHave fun!\n\nCredits:\n- Bethesda Softworks for a great game.\n- Razor 1911 for the easy cracked installation. You guys are the best.\n- RELOADED for the final update that made possible to mod the game in ways that I never believed.\n\nRemember:\nSEED!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7f82622b13cd34d61406db43073468ddcef5291","amp;dn":"The+Elder+Scrolls+V+Skyrim+crack+plus+all+dlcs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7f82622b13cd34d61406db43073468ddcef5291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,248,38,34,177,60,211,77,97,64,109,180,48,115,70,141,220,239,82,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
