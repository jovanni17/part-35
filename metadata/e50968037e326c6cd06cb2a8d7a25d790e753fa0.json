Whisky While I Wait\n\nJesse Thomas is the perfect example of a giant musical fireball in a small package. Her raspy, distressed vocals and straight-forward lyrics make for a big emotional sound on every song she releases.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been two years since Jesse released her debut EP, Hazel, and exactly one year since Starbucks featured her song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You I WantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, as their free download artist of the week. This month, Jesse is releasing her debut LP, War Dancer. The ever-catchy Ã¢â‚¬Å“You I WantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is on the album along with 10 previously unreleased tracks. Overall, the record is beautifully produced to showcase the emotional complexity yet honest simplicity of JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing. Tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Song For YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feel so close that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing in your living room.\n\nThere are also some faster tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back to FightingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Already MineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that make it hard to stop tapping your foot with the music.\n\nThe verdict: War Dancer is a strong debut from Jesse ThomasÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth adding to your music library!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e50968037e326c6cd06cb2a8d7a25d790e753fa0","amp;dn":"Jesse+Thomas+-+War+Dancer+%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e50968037e326c6cd06cb2a8d7a25d790e753fa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,9,104,3,126,50,108,108,208,108,178,168,215,162,93,121,14,117,63,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
