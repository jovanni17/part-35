This incredible new film answers the questions:\nDo the people know how they are controlled?                                         \nDo they understand the systems of power that surround them, the modern propaganda machines of public relations that wash their brains and fill their minds full of ball games and mindless fluff?                                                      Is the population beginning to realize that governments throughout history have used the specter of fear to drive their populations to acquiesce to total tyranny?  \n\nTERRORSTORM examines September 11th, the Iraq War, the 7/7 Bombings in London, and the coming invasion of Iran to reveal the connections between these seemingly separate events. Jones reviews the current geopolitical structure in the shadow of 9/11 through a focused historical lens and uncovers accounts of government sponsored terrorism that are openly admitted to by western governments.             \n\nTrailer &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://infowars-shop.stores.yahoo.net/teascsyed.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://infowars-shop.stores.yahoo.net/teascsyed.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHELP SEED !\n\n- BhangWalla -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a8e1759717fb8338f2b84335178dcf18826e46b","amp;dn":"Terrorstorm.A.History.Of.Government.Sponsored.Terrorism.FS.DVDRI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a8e1759717fb8338f2b84335178dcf18826e46b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,142,23,89,113,127,184,51,143,43,132,51,81,120,220,241,136,38,228,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
