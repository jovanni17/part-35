Guitarist/vocalist Dustin Kensrue, guitarist Teppei Teranishi, bassist Eddie Breckenridge, and drummer Riley Breckenridge all knew each other from high school and the neighborhood skate park, and the usual round of practices, music competitions, and local gigs helped hone their new band's sound. By late 1999, Thrice had amassed enough material to cut a proper record. Working with Death by Stereo's Paul Miner, the quartet recorded 12 tracks and self-released the Identity Crisis LP in April 2000. More gigs followed, and Thrice's mounting buzz sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City's Louis Posen.\r\n\r\n*** Note to Downloaders: I have collected as much material as I could find.
