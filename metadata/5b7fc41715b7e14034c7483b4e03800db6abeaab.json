From John Lennon's infamous Royal Variety Performance joke about rattling jewellery \nto the Sex Pistols preaching anarchy in the year of the Silver Jubilee and today's pop stars \nlining up to be seen with the young princes, this is the story of the 'rock and royal years'.\n\nThis hour-long documentary helps celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee by looking back at \nthe 60 year relationship between pop and the royals - at the times they came harmoniously \ntogether, and at the times when pop republicanism threatened to tear the monarchy apart.\n\nSinger Tommy Steele talks about being one of the first rock'n'rollers to perform in front \nof the Queen, Sheila Ferguson from the Three Degrees reveals what Prince Charles really \nsaid to her at their concert in the run up to his 30th birthday, and Queen guitarist \nBrian May talks about what it was like to play on top of Buckingham Palace in front of \nmillions of viewers worldwide.\n\nTogether these stories reveal why Queen Elizabeth really is 'the rock'n'roll Queen'.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/V3Scy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/V3Scy.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n46mn 14s | 503 MiB | 720x400 | 1521 Kbps | 25.000 fps | AAC | 128 Kbps Vbr | 2 ch | QF 0.194","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b7fc41715b7e14034c7483b4e03800db6abeaab","amp;dn":"Ch4+-+Royal+History+of+Pop+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b7fc41715b7e14034c7483b4e03800db6abeaab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,127,196,23,21,183,225,64,52,199,72,59,78,3,128,13,182,171,234,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
