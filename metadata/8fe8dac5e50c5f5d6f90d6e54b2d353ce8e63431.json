Sega, on the other hand, was just a faltering arcade company with big aspirations and even bigger personalities. But all that would change with the arrival of Tom Kalinske, a former Mattel executive who knew nothing about videogames and everything about fighting uphill battles. His unconventional tactics, combined with the blood, sweat, and bold ideas of his renegade employees, completely transformed Sega and led to a ruthless, David-and-Goliath showdown with Nintendo. Little did he realize that Sega's success would create many new enemies and, most important, make Nintendo stronger than ever.\n\nThe battle was vicious, relentless, and highly profitable, eventually sparking a global corporate war that would be fought on several fronts: from living rooms and school yards to boardrooms and Congress. It was a once-in-a-lifetime, no-holds-barred conflict that pitted brother against brother, kid against adult, Sonic against Mario, and the United States against Japan.\n\nBased on more than two hundred interviews with former Sega and Nintendo employees, Console Wars is the tale of how Tom Kalinske miraculously turned an industry punch line into a market leader. Blake J. Harris brings into focus the warriors, the strategies, and the battles and explores how they transformed popular culture forever. Ultimately, Console Wars is the story of how a humble family man, with an extraordinary imagination and a gift for turning problems into competitive advantages, inspired a team of underdogs to slay a giant and, as a result, give birth to a sixty-billion-dollar industry.\n\nKirkus Reviews\n2014-04-20\nLong before Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were scrapping it out on retail shelves, a small but nimble competitor very nearly unseated Nintendo. Welcome to the Console Wars.This history of the battle for video game market supremacy between Sega's Genesis gaming system and Nintendo's SNES console is the source material for not only an upcoming documentary co-directed by the author, but also a Scott Rudin-produced Hollywood film being written and produced by geek icons Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen (This Is the End), who contribute a funny introduction here. The good news is that despite being a bit lopsided in its portrayal of the players involved, the book is a highly entertaining behind-the-scenes thriller in which price fixing, psychotically aggressive marketing schemes and, occasionally, genuine innovation all come into play. Harris posits the fight between the two companies as a David-vs.-Goliath battle between Nintendo, which dominated the video game industry in the post-Atari era, and Sega, which valued audacious ideas, aggressive branding and more mature games. The nominal hero of the book is Tom Kalinske, a former Matchbox marketing executive sought out by Hayao Nakayama to run Sega's American division, which had just 50 employees. Kalinske fought a competitive campaign starting with the &quot;Sixteen Weeks of Summer&quot; in 1991, during which Sega carried out an inspired insurgency to diminish the launch of the SNES. The edginess of the company's advertising and productsÃ¢â‚¬â€think of the speed and scale of Sonic the Hedgehog versus the trusty familiarity of Mario and LinkÃ¢â‚¬â€shook the market like no upstart had before. Meanwhile, Harris also tracks a quirky Icelandic physics student named Olaf Olafsson, who was quietly helping Sony build a giant-killer of their own.It's hard to say whether the book is better than the movie(s), but whether readers are gamers or just enjoyed The Social Network, they'll be spoiled for choice here.\n\nBlake J. Harris is a writer and filmmaker based out of New York. He is currently co-directing the documentary based on his book, which is being produced by Scott Rudin, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg. He will also serve as an executive producer on Sony's feature-film adaptation of Console Wars","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe8dac5e50c5f5d6f90d6e54b2d353ce8e63431","amp;dn":"Blake+J.+Harris+-+Console+Wars-+Sega+vs+Nintendo+%5BV8%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe8dac5e50c5f5d6f90d6e54b2d353ce8e63431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,232,218,197,229,12,95,93,111,144,214,229,75,45,53,60,232,230,52,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
