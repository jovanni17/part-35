Self-professed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpost-punk electronic balladeersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the London duo of Erik Stein (lead vocals/rhythm piano) and Jon Boux (lead piano/rhythm vocals) have created a unique piano/synth (no guitars to be seen!) sound that uncannily captures both the subtlety and sophistication of Erik SteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal lyrical stylings. \n\nJudging from the understated sophistication of Paper Wraps Rock, it is hard to imagine that neither the classically trained Boux nor the human encyclopedia of underground pop music Stein have been in any other band prior to Cult With No Name. Accordingly the obligatory mentioning of past bands which in most instances includes mostly bands nobody knows anyway will be dispensed with. However if you do not find this to your liking, well letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦they were in the crowd at the 1966 Beatles concert at Shea Stadium. Just checking to see if you actually read these things. \n\nSeriously, although Paper Wraps Rock has a very prominent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ1980ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (whatever that means) to it, it would be impossible to categorize their music without references to such important artists ranging in time (and style) as Erik Satie, George Gershwin, Keith Jarrett, Court and Spark era Joni Mitchell and Honky Chateau era Elton John. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ references would have to include Wire, Shriekback, Roxy Music, Tuxedo Moon and strangely, 17 Pygmies (no wonder they are on Trakwerx!). \n\nIt is TrakwerxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ humble opinion that the first decade of the year 2000 will go down in musical history as the time in which the cynicism of the music industry caught up and nearly ruined for those who actually like and admire musical accomplishment (can anyone explain to me why we care which ex-mousekateer is not in rehab and at the top of the charts for that week?). Cult With No Name does not contain anyone who ever shilled a nickel for any nameless, faceless, corporate entity, and they write killer songs. Good enough for me.
