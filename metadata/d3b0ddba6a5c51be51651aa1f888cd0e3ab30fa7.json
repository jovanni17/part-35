Unlike\nmany nonperiod designs, it derives its power from the torsion spring- a winding of rope twisted very tightly\nthat springs back violently. It is very easy to load, aim, and fire. If the finishing touches are put on the\nreloading mechanism, it will genuinely require three people to operate, but will fire very rapidly. Power can\nbe adjusted to suit local standards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3b0ddba6a5c51be51651aa1f888cd0e3ab30fa7","amp;dn":"THE+OZNOG%5C%27S+HOMEMADE+BALLISTA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3b0ddba6a5c51be51651aa1f888cd0e3ab30fa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,176,221,186,106,92,81,190,81,101,26,161,248,136,205,14,58,179,15,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
