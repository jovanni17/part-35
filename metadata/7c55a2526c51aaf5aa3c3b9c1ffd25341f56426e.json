After 86 years, the\nBoston Red Sox finally won the World Series. One hundred and two days\nlater, the Patriots won the Super Bowl Ã¢â‚¬â€ again, making this win its third\nin four years. The city is full of excitement and pride. What could be a\nbetter time to visit Boston than now? In this city, you notice the people,\nso many of them in their late teens and early twenties. Wow, Boston really\nis a college town! And that quintessential frat-boy fashion statement, the\nbaseball cap, is everywhere. You see Red Sox caps on everyone from\ntoddlers in strollers to residents of nursing homes. Soon you realize that\nsome of the seniors have been rooting for their beloved team since they\nwere in baby carriages. EveryoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still grinning over the SoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2004\nWorld Series title.\nThe cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinctive red-brick buildings surround lush parks and overlook\na dazzling harbor. Most of the buildings and the parks stand on a\nlandfill. And although itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to believe, the prettiest park (the Public\nGarden) is entirely manmade. Just two decades ago, pollution overwhelmed\nthe harbor, and a federal judge ordered the massive cleanup\nthat resulted in the entrancing body of water you see today.\nIn Boston, the past, present, and future collide. Right beside a 21st century\nskyscraper will be a building that housed a turning point of\ncolonial history. To reach a tempting boutique, you pass a street musician\nwho turns out to be a student at one of the Boston areaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worldclass\nconservatories. Follow your nose to a tempting ethnic restaurant;\nimmigrants have shaped Boston for nearly 400 years, and your tasty\nmeal may come with an introduction to the latest newcomers.\nThe more time you spend in Boston, the more you understand, but even\na one-day visit can give you a good sense of this multifaceted city.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c55a2526c51aaf5aa3c3b9c1ffd25341f56426e","amp;dn":"Boston.for.Dummies+3rd+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c55a2526c51aaf5aa3c3b9c1ffd25341f56426e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,85,162,82,108,81,170,245,170,60,59,156,31,253,37,52,31,86,66,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
