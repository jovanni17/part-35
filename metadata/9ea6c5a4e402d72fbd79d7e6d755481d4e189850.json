Malone) to a meeting. Oddly, he requires each to bring an oxygen cylinder with him.\n\nWhat he soon informs them is that from astronomical data and just-received telegraphs of strange accidents on the other side of the world, he has deduced that the Earth is starting to move through a region of space containing something poisonous to humankind.\n\nShutting themselves tightly up in ChallengerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house, they start to consider what may be done. But as their countrymen start to drop, will their oxygen last long enough to determine and implement a solution?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ea6c5a4e402d72fbd79d7e6d755481d4e189850","amp;dn":"The+Poison+Belt+by+Sir+Arthur+Conan+Doyle+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ea6c5a4e402d72fbd79d7e6d755481d4e189850","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,166,197,164,228,2,215,47,189,121,215,230,215,85,72,29,78,24,152,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
