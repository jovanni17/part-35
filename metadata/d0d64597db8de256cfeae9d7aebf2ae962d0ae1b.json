The chapters concisely clarify the interrelated subjects of terrain, climate, and the great movements of the earth itself while illustrating the important changes that are still occurring in the areaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rivers, lakes, plains, and unpredictable weather. Brimming with fascinating facts, educational sidebars tell how earthquakes in New Madrid, Missouri caused waves to go upstream in the Mississippi River; why and how tornadoes form; and how invasive species are threatening the Great Lakes and what people are doing about it. Young readers can explore further with hands-on experiments and projects that include panning for gold, creating a tornado, engineering a flood, and making a profile of the local soil","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0d64597db8de256cfeae9d7aebf2ae962d0ae1b","amp;dn":"Geology+of+the+Great+Plains+and+Mountain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0d64597db8de256cfeae9d7aebf2ae962d0ae1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,214,69,151,219,141,226,86,207,234,233,215,174,191,42,233,98,208,174,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
