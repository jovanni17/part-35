After her friend leaves, the man tries to rape her, and she is saved only by the handsome Kiyoshi. Later, against the background of the tumultuous 1960 U.S./Japan Security Treaty demonstrations, Kiyoshi and Mako walk along a grungy seaside lumberyard while talking about sex. He attempts to kiss her, she slaps him, and he throws her in the water. She cries out that she can&amp;#039;t swim. When she continues to refuse his advances, he steps on her fingers as she clings to a log. Kiyoshi then saves Mako from a trio of seedy pimps looking to impress her into working for them, but after rescuing her, he forces himself on her again. With this unlikely beginning, Kiyoshi and Mako form a passionate though doomed romance. Soon she stops going to school and moves into his flea-ridden dive of an apartment. Utterly disillusioned with all trappings of societal convention, the two get cash by blackmailing businessmen and by shaking down Kiyoshi&amp;#039;s middle-aged sugarmama. Tension with this Bonnie and Clyde duo builds after Mako has an abortion in a run down clinic, performed by an alcoholic doctor.\n    With the savage fury of a cry from hell, this landmark Japanese teen drama is a brutal, scathing attack on the moral and cultural vacuity of Japan&amp;#039;s newfound affluence after World War II. Cruel Story of Youth has widely been compared to Rebel Without a Cause; like Nicholas Ray&amp;#039;s film, it features disillusioned teens rebelling against everything without really understanding why. Unlike its American counterpart, Cruel Story of Youth is unrelentingly dark and gritty, depicting mindless or coerced sex and brutal violence in a chillingly offhand manner. Made at a time when the restrained sentimentality of Yasujiro Ozu or existential humanism of Akira Kurosawa were the norm, this film shocks because of the social taboos it transgresses and the amount of venom it directs towards Japanese society. In style and politics, it bears a strong resemblance to Jean-Luc Godard&amp;#039;s French New Wave masterpiece Breathless, released a year earlier. Both films gleefully subverted well-worn genres for their own political and aesthetic ends; and both employed a fresh, defiant style based on the hand-held camera. The success of Cruel Story of Youth ushered in the Japanese New Wave and established Nagisa Oshima as one of Japan&amp;#039;s most prominent and daring directors.\n\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
