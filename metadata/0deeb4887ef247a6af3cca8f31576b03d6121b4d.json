In the glory days of Paul Morphy it was considered almost cowardly to play anything else.\n\nLegends such as Spassky and Bronstein kept the flame burning in the 20th century, but its popularity faded as players became distrustful of WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultra-aggressive approach. Nevertheless there are honorable exceptions whose games prove that this ancient weapon can still draw blood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Short, Nakamura and Zvjaginsev are world-class players who have used the KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gambit successfully.\n\nIn this groundbreaking work, grandmaster John Shaw shows that the ultimate Romantic chess opening remains relevant and dangerous even in the computer era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0deeb4887ef247a6af3cca8f31576b03d6121b4d","amp;dn":"The+King%27s+Gambit+%28John+Shaw%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0deeb4887ef247a6af3cca8f31576b03d6121b4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,238,180,136,126,242,71,166,175,60,202,143,49,87,107,3,214,18,27,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
