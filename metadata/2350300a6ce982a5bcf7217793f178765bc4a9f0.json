ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why The Complete Android Guide \nwas created. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a comprehensive run-down of everything your phone can do, written from the perspective of the curious user.\nWith screenshots, step-by-step instructions, and explanations of how everything fits together in plain English, new Android users will unlock their phoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potential, and journeyman Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdroid fans will pick up some new tricks.\n\nAs Android changes and updates, so does this guide. The Complete Android Guide is updated as soon as possible after \nnew Android versions arrive on phones and tablets, and major variations are covered, like MotorolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Motoblur and \nHTCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sense UI. When new, cool apps come out, we include them in the extended features.
