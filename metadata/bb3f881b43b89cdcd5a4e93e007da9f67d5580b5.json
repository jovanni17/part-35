From her maternal grandmother, she learned where to find both: a land of lush forests, dazzling lakes, and centuries-old legends.\n\nIreland. County Mayo, to be exact. Where her ancestors' blood and magic have flowed through generationsÃ¢â‚¬â€and where her destiny awaits.\n\nIona arrives in Ireland with nothing but her Nan's directions, an unfailingly optimistic attitude, and an innate talent with horses. Not far from the luxurious castle where she is spending a week, she finds her cousins, Branna and Connor O'Dwyer. And since family is family, they invite her into their home and their lives.\n\nWhen Iona lands a job at the local stables, she meets the owner, Boyle McGrath. Cowboy, pirate, wild tribal horsemen, he's three of her biggest fantasy weaknesses all in one big, bold package.\n\nIona realizes that here she can make a home for herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€and live her life as she wants, even if that means falling head over heels for Boyle. But nothing is as it seems. An ancient evil has wound its way around Iona's family tree and must be defeated. Family and friends will fight with each other and for each other to keep the promise of hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€and loveÃ¢â‚¬â€aliveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nGenre: Romance/Paranormal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb3f881b43b89cdcd5a4e93e007da9f67d5580b5","amp;dn":"Dark_Witch_Book_One_of_The_Cousins_O%27Dwyer_Trilogy__by_Nora_Robe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb3f881b43b89cdcd5a4e93e007da9f67d5580b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,63,136,27,67,184,156,220,213,164,233,62,0,125,169,246,125,85,128,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
