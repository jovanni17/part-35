The main app is mainly intended for explaining how to actually add widgets to your home screen.\n[2] Automatic scrolling is enabled on Android 3.x and on most alternative launchers (e.g. ADW Launcher, Launcher Pro, Go Launcher Ex). When scrolling is not supported by your launcher (e.g. Zeam launcher, HTC Sense, Samsung Touchwiz) you must first click the widget's footer and the widget will become scrollable just until it looses focus.\n[3] Currently the calendar widget is not scrollable in its grid mode. Agenda view is fully scrollable though.\n[4] In Quick Event entering the edit window will ignore the reminder setting and the selected calendar, and use the default calendar application settings instead.\n[5] Reasons for every permission are available here httpandroidprowidgets..co...rmissions.html\n[6] We reserve the rights to change which features are only available to the licensed version.\n[7] Screenshot of people widget contains images by photostock  FreeDigitalPhotos.net\n[8] You can find ways to contact us in the About page of the main application. \n\n apw, widget, widgets package, widgets pack, scrollable, scrolling, calendar, agenda widget, quickadd, people widget, contacts widget, bookmarks widget, messaging widget, sms widget, facebook widget, twitter widget, honeycomb \n\n\nWhat's in this version:\n\n\n&gt; 1.2.5\n- Bugfix release\n- Don't use Select Account in bookmarks on Honeycomb.
