In the House of Flies opens with the two as they enjoy a night out on the town - walking hand-in-hand, laughing, bopping about an arcade, and contemplating the possibility of marriage. Just as the &quot;so 80s it hurts&quot; opening credit sequence ends, so does the fun. Heather and Steve get back into their car, only to find the smell of chemicals and promptly pass out. And yeesh, is that where the nightmare begins!\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 704x384, 23.976 fps, 648 Kbps, 01h30m38s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/8rde8fzor/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/xjqqx9le5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5kwl6ejrh/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/k1jukz98t/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/eh7dacadp/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:304415ff6614800a65afcd5f8866c6ded93cc4c7","amp;dn":"In+the+House+of+Flies+%282012+-+Canada%29+horror+thriller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"304415ff6614800a65afcd5f8866c6ded93cc4c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,68,21,255,102,20,128,10,101,175,205,95,136,102,198,222,217,60,196,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
