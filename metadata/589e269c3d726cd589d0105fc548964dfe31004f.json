It was described by the Sunday Times as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the sort of book that changes peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Since then, Desmond Morris has become one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authorities on human behaviour, writing numerous other bestsellers on the subject and is a familiar figure to millions of TV viewers for his series on human and animal behaviour.\n\nIn this new volume of autobiographical essays, he describes his travels and his observations of human beings and human behaviour in fascinating and often hilarious detail. It was these observations which provided the raw material for such remarkable books as Manwatching and The Human Sexes, and the films that have accompanied them. His travels have taken him from the cities of North America to Mediterranean islands and around the whole of Europe in search of material for Gestures, and to the Pacific and around Africa for The Human Race Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a total of some sixty countries throughout the world. The final chapter describes his recent journey around the world in ninety days.\n\nISBN 0091878675 \nISBN13: 9780091878672","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:589e269c3d726cd589d0105fc548964dfe31004f","amp;dn":"Desmond+Morris+-+2001+-+The+Naked+Eye+-+Travels+in+Search+of+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"589e269c3d726cd589d0105fc548964dfe31004f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,158,38,156,61,114,108,213,137,208,16,95,197,72,150,77,254,49,0,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
