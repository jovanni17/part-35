WORM's core mission is to provide free access to over 5000 items of international (sub)cultural importance; recorded on different formats such as VHS, DVD, LP and Cassette; as well as a library of books, magazines, gadgets and games. \r\n\r\nThe WORM Pirate Bay database will also be made accessible online. Users will be able to reserve items online, but will need to pick them up at the WORM Pirate Bay itself. A service desk and a unique preview space, designed by Amy Suo Wu, is open to all visitors. Here they can experience the media in its actual form.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nCheck out the project's complete info kit for: \r\n\r\n- an invitation to the launch on September 9th!\r\n\r\n- volunteering opportunities\r\n\r\n- details on the project\r\n\r\n- logos\r\n\r\n- pictures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81bb2d297b2c790e8e6abeb270ce4d4b5e3f61b3","amp;dn":"WORM+Pirate+Bay+info+kit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81bb2d297b2c790e8e6abeb270ce4d4b5e3f61b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,187,45,41,123,44,121,14,142,106,190,178,112,206,77,75,94,63,97,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
