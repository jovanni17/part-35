Singer/songwriter Aimee Mann also guest stars, alongside James Mercer (The Shins), and local Portland musicians Jenny Conlee and Colin Meloy (The Decemberists) and Corin Tucker (Sleater-Kinney).\n\nBrownstein and Armisen spent years observing the joyous eccentricities of Portland, Oregon (when Fred was on hiatus from SNL), which spawned their &quot;Thunderant&quot; project, a compilation of online videos that combined their unique music styles and comedic sensibilities.\nTheir artistic collaboration garnered an online cult following, as their &quot;Thunderant&quot; characters resonated with a young audience celebrating individuality, free spirit and weirdness. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&amp;id=213221&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&amp;id=213221&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[pre]...............................................\n.
