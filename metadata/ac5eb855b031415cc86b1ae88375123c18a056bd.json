The band started to audition singers while writing the new album, and they eventually chose Steve Hogarth. The music for Seasons End was mostly finished by the time Hogarth joined Marillion, and only a couple of songs on it actually have some pieces written by him, most notably &quot;Easter&quot; and &quot;The Space&quot;. A number of the lyrics were written by John Helmer, who the band had commissioned before Hogarth joining. He would continue to contribute lyrics throughout the 1990s. Much of the music on Seasons End had been composed while Fish was still in the band.\n\nThe album was originally released on CD, Cassette, vinyl LP and 12&quot; Picture Disc. &quot;After Me&quot;, the b-side of &quot;Hooks in You&quot;, was included as a bonus track on the original CD and cassette versions.\n\nIn 1997, as part of a series of Marillion's first eight studio albums, EMI re-released Seasons End with remastered sound and a second disc containing bonus material. The bonus disc contained the extended 12&quot; version of the album's second single, &quot;The Uninvited Guest&quot;, that single's b-side &quot;The Bell in the Sea&quot;, the third single &quot;Easter&quot;'s b-side, &quot;The Release&quot;, and six demo versions.
