What was the inspiration behind them? And how do they sound when performed &quot;unplugged&quot; by the composer themselves?\n\nThis innovative series explores the magic of song-writing with some of today's most successful talents. An intimate interview in which they discuss their song-writing careers, the process of constructing and developing the song, and their hopes and fears once it was completed, followed by an 'unplugged' performance of the tune in question. Songbook is presented by music journalist and author of Guitar Man and Song Man, Will Hodgkinson.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe pop song is a powerful art form, simple and universal yet hugely difficult to get right,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ comments Hodgkinson. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLearning from songwriting greats about how they wrote their most famous songs has been a fascinating, rewarding experience.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1003 KB/s\nResolution .........: 624 x 352\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.77:1\nTotal frames .......: 69918 frames\nframerate ..........: 25 FPS\n\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efb943eef9c6a1963e6124483b4dd5acc5ba3b54","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+Songbook+performance+%282009-03-26%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efb943eef9c6a1963e6124483b4dd5acc5ba3b54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,185,67,238,249,198,161,150,62,97,36,72,59,77,213,172,197,186,59,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
