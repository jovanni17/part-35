It is always the Bankers that did it.  \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nConfessions of an Economic Hit Man:\nWell if your eyes were closed prepare them to be opened in this interview with John Perkins author of &quot;Confessions of an Economic Hit Man&quot;.\n\nFrom the author of the phenomenal New York Times bestseller, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, comes an exposÃƒÂ© of international corruption, and an inspired plan to turn the tide for future generations\n\nWith a presidential election around the corner, questions of America's military buildup, environmental impact, and foreign policy are on everyone's mind. Former Economic Hit Man John Perkins goes behind the scenes of the current geopolitical crisis and offers bold solutions to our most pressing problems. Drawing on interviews with other EHMs, jackals, CIA operatives, reporters, businessmen, and activists, Perkins reveals the secret history of events that have created the current American Empire, including:\n\n   How the defeats in Vietnam and Iraq have benefited big business\n   The role of Israel as Fortress America in the Middle East\n   Tragic repercussions of the IMF's Asian Economic Collapse\n   The current Latin American revolution and its lessons for democracy\n   U.S. blunders in Tibet, Congo, Lebanon, and Venezuela\n\nFrom the U.S. military in Iraq to infrastructure development in Indonesia, from Peace Corps volunteers in Africa to jackals in Venezuela, Perkins exposes a conspiracy of corruption that has fueled instability and anti-Americanism around the globe, with consequences reflected in our daily headlines. Having raised the alarm, Perkins passionately addresses how Americans can work to create a more peaceful and stable world for future generations.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGood guys - Whistleblowers are heroes:\nThe story everyone should hear.  Although Beacon Press lost its legal battle for being the first to public the Pentagon Papers, their story is being told now. Its two-and-a-half year battle against prosecution and intimidation is now being commemorated, in hindsight, by journalists and thought leaders with spines. Here are their names discussed in the video, along with some new heroes.\n\nRobert West, The Beacon Press\n\nMike Gravel\n\nDaniel Ellsberg\n\nBradley Manning\n\nEdward Snowden\n\nand ALL our loyal fellow citizens who put it all on the line to expose criminality in government.

Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
