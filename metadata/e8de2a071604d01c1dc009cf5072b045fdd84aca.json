The first set featured five songs over ten minutes in length, including top-notch versions of &quot;Desdemona&quot; and &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man,&quot; plus Warren Haynes finishing off the magnificent &quot;Dreams&quot; trifecta.  &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; shows why Gregg Allman is still considered one of the finest blues singers ever.  Rob Barraco adds immensely to fantastic takes on &quot;The Same Thing&quot; and &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed,&quot; Oteil pays a beautiful tribute to Ray Charles in his bass solo, and a thunderous &quot;Whipping Post&quot; brings the Fox run to an earth-shattering conclusion!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8de2a071604d01c1dc009cf5072b045fdd84aca","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+09%2F26%2F2004+%5B320k+MP3%5D+Atlanta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8de2a071604d01c1dc009cf5072b045fdd84aca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,222,42,7,22,4,208,28,29,192,9,207,80,114,176,69,253,216,74,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
