This book describes the development and use of autogyros and helicopters in Germany up to 1945, plus the postwar use of German machines, and their influence on later helicopter designs, in other countries.The author was one of the very first Polish helicopter pilots trained in 1956. For many years a test pilot and senior instructor, he has lectured Serieson helicopter theory and applications and is the author of many books and articles on rotorcraft; he is also the Chairman of the Experimental Test Pilots' Club and President of Polish Aviation Seniors' Club.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797914a2bd675d2d88b616860fb155a94167cad8","amp;dn":"Rotorcraft+Of+The+Third+Reich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797914a2bd675d2d88b616860fb155a94167cad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,121,20,162,189,103,93,45,136,182,22,134,15,177,85,169,65,103,202,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
