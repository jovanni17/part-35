Each chapter begins with a discussion of their most popular song, but leads to stories of their history and place in the scene, ultimately painting a vivid picture of this colorful, idiosyncratic time. Mixtape suggestions, fashion sidebars, and quotes from famous contemporary admirers help fill out the fun. Participants include members of Duran Duran, New Order, The Smiths, Tears for Fears, Adam Ant, Echo and the Bunnymen, Devo, ABC, Spandau Ballet, A Flock of Seagulls, Thompson Twins, and INXS.\n\n\nBy Jonathan Bernstein, Lori Majewski\nPublished by Abrams in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 320 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff6b7557b688132df4bdb457f56c60144f048874","amp;dn":"Mad+World++%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff6b7557b688132df4bdb457f56c60144f048874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,107,117,87,182,136,19,45,244,189,180,87,245,108,96,20,79,4,136,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
