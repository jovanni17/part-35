Now, almost half a century later, he revisits DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work with the skills of an eminent American historian as well as the passion of a fan.\n \nBeginning with DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s explosion onto the scene in 1961, Wilentz follows the emerging artist as he develops a body of work unique in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cultural history. Using his unprecedented access to studio tapes, recording notes, and rare photographs, he places DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music in the context of its time and offers a stunning critical appreciation of Dylan both as a songwriter and performer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a3b010401d662549cd8d58a203b0567b2002eb","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+in+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a3b010401d662549cd8d58a203b0567b2002eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,163,176,16,64,29,102,37,73,205,141,88,162,3,176,86,123,32,2,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
