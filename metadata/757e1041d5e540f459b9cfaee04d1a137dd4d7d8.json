British agent Magnus Pym?s training begins in a chaotic childhood. His charismatic con man father trades secrets for love, bouncing in and out of jail and his son?s life. Schooled at Oxford and mentored by two masters of espionage, Magnus is poised for greatness except that his mentors are on opposite sides of the battle. \n\nLe CarrÃƒÂ© weaves a gripping tale of international intrigue brilliantly adapted for the BBC by Arthur Hopcraft, who also adapted le CarrÃƒÂ©&amp;#039;s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy for television. A Perfect Spy stars Peter Egan (Reilly: Ace of Spies) and Ray McAnally (A Very British Coup) with an exceptional supporting cast featuring Alan Howard, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, and Sarah Badel. \n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:757e1041d5e540f459b9cfaee04d1a137dd4d7d8","amp;dn":"LE_CARRE_A_PERFECT_SPY_DISC2_DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"757e1041d5e540f459b9cfaee04d1a137dd4d7d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,126,16,65,213,229,64,244,89,185,207,174,224,77,26,19,125,212,215,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
