The 12 songs here are all high quality, and they hit across a wide range of styles within bluegrass. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Standing By Your SideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Southern StyleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are catchy, upbeat songs dominated by the banjo, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Behind the BulletÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a minor-key stomper and Ã¢â‚¬Å“My HometownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a great ballad. The high speed instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“AlleghenyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows off the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s considerable picking skills, as does the equally fast kiss off Ã¢â‚¬Å“Go to HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The a cappella Ã¢â‚¬Å“Towing the ChainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ demonstrates that the band can harmonize as well as they can play, and is just about the only place on the album where a sharp-eared listener can pick up a hint of Mustered CourageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Aussie accents.\n\nThe dark lyrics, modern setting, and roots-rock feel of Ã¢â‚¬Å“PowerlinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows that the band has more on their minds than just replicating traditional types of bluegrass songs. And while some may gripe that a bunch of Australians know nothing about southern hospitality or riding a steam train from Tennessee to New Orleans, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like most modern American bluegrass acts have actually experienced those things, either. The bottom line is that Mustered Courage has the style, songwriting and chops to stand toe to toe with most of their American contemporaries, and Powerlines is worth a listen to bluegrass fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d71a45940828fed846e3a40bb50413421cb596","amp;dn":"Mustered+Courage+-+Powerlines+%28320CBR%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d71a45940828fed846e3a40bb50413421cb596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,215,26,69,148,8,40,254,216,70,227,164,11,181,4,19,66,28,181,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
