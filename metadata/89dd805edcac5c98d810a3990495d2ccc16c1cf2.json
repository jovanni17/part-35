In fact is for life.\n\nI found this in a torrent signed mad_dog along with \nCapture One 6.2.1 - 32bits.\nI tried this with several versions including the last \nCapture One 6.3.2 - 64bits on Windows 7 64bits and it works like a charm.\n\nHow to use:\n1.Install any version of Capture One 6.2 or newer (on Phase \nOne's home sites you'll find the last version - 6.3.2 for now). &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.phaseone.com/en/Downloads/SoftwareArchive/CaptureOneArchiveWin.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.phaseone.com/en/Downloads/SoftwareArchive/CaptureOneArchiveWin.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2.Don't start Capture One.\n\n3.Put the file CaptureOne6.cmd on your desktop.\n\n4.If you've installed Capture One in default location (on C:\\Program Files...)\nyou can use CaptureOne6.cmd for starting the program. You'll see a License window.\nChoose &quot;Try (30 days left)&quot; and &quot;Capture One Pro&quot; from the pop-up list, then hit \non the bottom right the &quot;Try&quot; button. Don't try to activate. Every time you want \nto start the program you have to double click CaptureOne6.cmd. Forget about the\noriginal Capture One icon/shorcut.\n\n5.If you have installed Capture One anywhere else than default location, \nthen you have to edit CaptureOne6.cmd file, according with your new location.\nYou cand edit cmd file with notepad, wordpad... etc.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89dd805edcac5c98d810a3990495d2ccc16c1cf2","amp;dn":"Capture+One+Pro+6+mad_dog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89dd805edcac5c98d810a3990495d2ccc16c1cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,221,128,94,220,172,92,152,216,16,163,153,4,149,210,204,193,108,28,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
