CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cile de France as Marie Lelay, a French television journalist who survives a tsunami.[3][7] Frankie and George McLaren as Marcus and Jason, twin brothers. Jason is killed in a car accident early in the film, and Marcus later attempts to contact him in the afterlife.[8] Eastwood selected the two actors to play the brothers despite them having never acted before because he did not want &quot;child actors who'd been over-instructed in Child Acting 101.&quot;[6]Lyndsey Marshal as Jackie, Marcus and Jason's mother, a heroin addict.[7]\nThierry Neuvic as Didier, Marie's lover. Neuvic was on holiday in Corsica in September 2009 when he was called to audition for a role in the film. His audition, which took place at a Paris hotel, lasted 15 minutes, and he read two scenes for Eastwood. Most of Neuvic's scenes were filmed in Paris.[9] Jay Mohr as Billy Lonegan, George's older brother.[10\n\n\nPLOT: Hereafter is a 2010 American drama fantasy film directed by Clint Eastwood from a screenplay by Peter Morgan.
