You are Elvis. Home owner, triangular metal person and lover of dryness. A sudden thunderstorm leaves your house dissolved into a pile of rubble. Only lightning-fast reactions will keep you from a looming rusty funeral. Don your Shifty Suit to incognito yourself and walk among suspicious hairy folk. Perilous puzzles and prejudiced platforms will bar your way in this deceptively deep gaming dish.\r\nSlip into the Shifty Suit! â€“ Blast through this fast-paced platformer and instantly shift from rusty red to hairy blue to influence how the whole environment reacts to you.\r\nStill stepping on the floor? â€“ Magnetic boots deliver a unique platform mechanic in multiple dimensions. Walk both walls and ceilings, and prepare for an adrenaline rush from treacherous puzzles.\r\nA gloomy tale in finest comic art! â€“ Feast your eyes on the trademark Black Pants art style in this beautiful and bleak platformer and its miniature world with even smaller inhabitants. Eyes! FEAST!\r\nSpite and prejudice! â€“ Stimulate your brains with a story about the loss of a low-rent flat, complicated misunderstandings and a looming war. And there is even forbidden romance.\r\nIt creaks, it cracks, it crunches!â€‹ â€“â€‹ A dark and melodic soundtrack with an eclectic selection of music. Haunting robotic sounds for your rainy days and the industrial revolution.â€‹\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: CPU with SSE2 support required (Core 2 Duo, Athlon X2 or newer)\r\nMemory: 2048 MB RAM\r\nGraphics: OpenGL 3.1 or higher required (Intel HD series, NVIDIA GeForce 8000 series, AMD Radeon HD series or newer)\r\nStorage: 2 GB available space\r\nMouse, Keyboard\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: Quad core processor, Intel Core i5, AMD Athlon X4 or better\r\nMemory: 4096 MB RAM\r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce or AMD Radeon with 1024MB VRAM recommended","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94d1cd7f92d9b5cf65efeccbc9fd4fcff7eb8b12","amp;dn":"On+Rusty+Trails+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94d1cd7f92d9b5cf65efeccbc9fd4fcff7eb8b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,209,205,127,146,217,181,207,101,239,236,203,201,253,79,207,247,235,139,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
