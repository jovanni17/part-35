The case and booklet list &quot;The Hotel Family Affair&quot; and &quot;Black Sea Me&quot; together as one track, but they are separate tracks on the disc itself. Despite this minor error, the album was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Recording Package. The album features an appearance by Tool drummer Danny Carey, as well as an assortment of artists and musicians from the Los Angeles scene.\n\nLusk included Paul D'Amour (Feersum Ennjin, Replicants, Tool), Chris Pitman (SexTapes, Guns N' Roses, Replicants, Zaum), Greg Edwards (Autolux, Failure, Replicants) and Brad Laner. \n\n   1. &quot;Backworlds&quot;\n   2. &quot;Savvy Kangaroos&quot;\n   3. &quot;Gold&quot;\n   4. &quot;Free Mars&quot;\n   5. &quot;Doctor&quot;\n   6. &quot;Mindray&quot;\n   7. &quot;The Hotel Family Affair&quot;\n   8. &quot;Black Sea Me&quot;\n   9. &quot;Undergarden&quot;\n  10. &quot;Kill The King&quot;\n  11. &quot;My Good Fishwife&quot; / &quot;Blair's Spiders&quot; (hidden track)\n\n[img]http://pauldamour.com/paulsite/FEERSUM_ENNJIN-MUSIC_files/shapeimage_4.png[/img]\n\n[b]Lusk - 4-songs[/b] (unreleased EP, 2002)\n\n01.

There was a YouTube video submitted a few years ago playing short 30 second clips of all 4 songs from this EP along with titles for each, but that video has since been removed. Anyone out there know the title of track 3 and/or have a copy of it?\n\n[url]http://pauldamour.com[/url]\n[url]http://feersumennjin.net[/url]\n\n[IMG]http://pauldamour.com/paulsite/FEERSUM_ENNJIN-MUSIC_files/shapeimage_3.png[/IMG]\n\n[b]Feersum Ennjin[/b] (2006)\n\n01.
