All of the members of the band are incredibly talented on their respective instrument...\n...There aren't any bad tracks on this album, but among all the highlights I have to give special mention to &quot;Zakir&quot;, &quot;Airbus&quot; and &quot;Kasams&quot;, they really blow me away every time I listen...\n...So overall this is really aggressive, jazzy music from three guys who play exceptionally well together, and whose future works I'm eagerly looking forward to. This is undoubtedly one of the best albums of the past decade and my favorite from 2008...&quot;\n-- SaltyJon / www.progrchives.com --\n\n&quot;...Jean Louis's debut is nothing short of spectacular and is one of the finest RIO/Avant-prog albums to be found anywhere. The band is definitely not one to be missed, with their great interplay and undeniably weighty grooves and will appeal to jazz, noise, and math rock fans. This album is an absolutely essential one for any serious collector of avant-garde music and to any prog fan in general.&quot;\n-- Evolutionary Sleeper / www.progarchives.com --\n\nForget about my previous uploads of that genre.
