Reproduced in these pages are some 200 artworks-ranging from temple decoration and bronze sculpture to medieval court painting and cave frescoes accompanied by excerpts from the Sir Richard Burton translation of the original text and a discussion of the historical context in which these images were created.\n\nLong treasured as an uninhibited exaltation of erotic and mystical bliss, the Kama Sutra, as illuminated here, is a sublime gift for lovers and lovers of beautiful art.\n\n\nEnglish | 105 pages | PDF | 62.8 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c7a7fbe9bee065a37ee0e60f4f2e5e615d1d56","amp;dn":"The.Kama.Sutra.Figures.in.Indian.Art.BD.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c7a7fbe9bee065a37ee0e60f4f2e5e615d1d56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,199,167,251,233,190,224,101,163,126,224,230,15,79,46,94,97,93,29,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
