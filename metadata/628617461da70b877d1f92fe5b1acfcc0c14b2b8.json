Judas Priest issued several singles that would include non-album B-sides with many of the singles, to entice fans who already had the A-side on their full-length to purchase the single. This Japanese-only CD compilation of live &amp; rare cuts is lifted from assorted 7' &amp; 12' singles. There is also an official Austrian CD version of the album, released by Epic Records with the number 493008-2 and same track listing and artwork.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    Beyond the Realms of Death (Live in Cleveland 1978) 7:04\n    White Heat, Red Hot (Live in Cleveland 1978) 4:32\n    Starbreaker (Live in Cleveland 1978) 7:19\n    Breaking the Law (Live in Europe 1981) 2:35\n    Living After Midnight (Live in Europe 1981) 4:19\n    The Green Manalishi (Live in US Festival 1983) 5:01\n    Breaking the Law (Live in US Festival 1983) 2:44\n    You've Got Another Thing Comin' (Live in US Festival 1983) 7:34\n    Private Property (Live at Kiel Auditorium, St. Louis 1986) 5:10\n    Turbo Lover (Hi-Octane Mix) 7:21\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:628617461da70b877d1f92fe5b1acfcc0c14b2b8","amp;dn":"Judas+Priest+-+Priest%2C+Live+And+Rare+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"628617461da70b877d1f92fe5b1acfcc0c14b2b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,134,23,70,29,167,11,135,125,31,146,254,91,26,207,204,12,20,178,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
