The more than 350 works represent all major American sculptors and schools from the early nineteenth century to the present day, making this a valuable survey in a field where little published information is available. Many of the biographies include characteristic or diverting excerpts from heretofore unpublished letters written to the Museum by the sculptors themselves, describing their lives and work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:943303add84cbe2a8cdbff00e48810ec8a2aa2b5","amp;dn":"American+Sculpture+-+A+Catalogue+of+the+Collection+of+The+Metrop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"943303add84cbe2a8cdbff00e48810ec8a2aa2b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,51,3,173,216,76,190,42,140,219,255,0,228,136,16,236,138,42,162,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
