It was directed by Stephen Ives, the executive producer was Ken Burns and the narrator was Peter Coyote. The film originally aired on PBS in September 1996.\n\nStephen Ives and Ken Burns had worked together on several films, including The Civil War (1990) and Baseball (1994). In 1988, Ives created his own production company, Insignia Films, and began working on The West as director, with Burns signed on to the project as executive producer. In order to create The West, the film crew traveled over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) via airplane, conducted 72 interviews, visited 74 archives and collections, and filmed more than 250 hours of footage. The film's production was funded by General Motors.\n\nEpisode 3: The Speck of the Future (1848Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1856)\n\n\n\nAired, September 17th 1996; Narrator Peter Coyote\n\n\n\nBy 1848 the United States had -- through negotiations, border skirmishes, full-blown war, and an intimidating belief in Manifest Destiny -- seized the West and became a continental nation, at least on paper. Then the word came that men in California had discovered gold. The Speck of the Future, Episode Three, covers the years from 1848 to 1856, when the American West quickly became the world's destination spot. Under greed's intoxicating influence, everyone from Chinese peasants and Mexican laborers to Latin American aristocrats and New York's boy next door fled westward and established a new kind of American community -- One based on exploitation as much as mutual need. We now explore the myriad ways in which the Gold Rush and unabashed greed forever altered the course of our history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b264bc6e24bf2cd63ce7269791457fb0f3ff3dd0","amp;dn":"PBS+Ken+Burns+The+West+3of9+The+Speck+of+the+Future+1995+DVD+720","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b264bc6e24bf2cd63ce7269791457fb0f3ff3dd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,100,188,110,36,191,44,214,60,231,38,151,145,69,127,176,243,255,61,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
