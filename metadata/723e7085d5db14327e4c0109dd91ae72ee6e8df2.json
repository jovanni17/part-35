AN INNOCENT CHILD IN\nHIS SIGHTS ... A WOMAN DRIVEN TO THE EDGE TO STOP HIM ...\n\nThe killer knows Eve Duncan all too well. He knows the pain she\nfeels for her murdered daughter, Bonnie, whose body has never\nbeen found. He knows that as one of the nation's top forensic\nsculptors she'll insist on identifying the nine skeletons unearthed on\na bluff near Georgia's Talladega Falls. He knows she won't be able to\nresist the temptation of believing that one of those skeletons might be\nher daughter's. But that is only the beginning of the killer's sadistic\ngame. He wants Eve one on one, and he'll use his ace in the hole to\nmake sure she complies. And he won't stop playing until he claims the\nprize he wants most: Eve's life.\n\n\n\nThe Killing Game (Eve Duncan #2)\nBy Iris Johansen\nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 513","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:723e7085d5db14327e4c0109dd91ae72ee6e8df2","amp;dn":"The+Killing+Game+%28Eve+Duncan+%232%29+By+Iris+Johansen.+EPUB+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"723e7085d5db14327e4c0109dd91ae72ee6e8df2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,62,112,133,213,219,20,50,126,76,1,9,221,145,174,114,238,110,141,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
