It was composed of area studio musicians under the tutelage of Wayne Moss and Mac Gayden. Barefoot Jerry was once a store next to Mac Gayden's home in the Smoky Mtns. Barefoot Jerry was actually an old style country fiddle player inside the store; Mac named the group for him.\nBoth Moss and Gayden were lead guitarists for Area Code 615, and also with other 615 alumni. This name is also used to refer to Moss and his sidemen in current reunions and other projects. Moss founded Cinderella Recording Studios and has operated it since 1960.\n\nMoss had previously played in many sessions, including Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde and played the guitar riff on Roy Orbison's &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. In addition to Moss, band members included: Terry Dearmore, Kenny Buttrey, Jim Colvard, Dave Doran, Si Edwards, Mac Gayden, John Harris, Warren Hartman, Russ Hicks, Kenny Malone, Charlie McCoy, and Fred Newell.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d26b591a7a8e778674a7a3c53a32d6a2b23b6f5","amp;dn":"Barefoot+Jerry+-+Same+%281973%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d26b591a7a8e778674a7a3c53a32d6a2b23b6f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,38,181,145,167,168,231,120,103,74,122,60,83,163,45,106,43,35,182,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
