No other drug has ever spread so fast. &quot;Peter Jennings Reporting - Ecstasy Rising&quot; tells the definitive story of how an obscure compound, discovered in 1912 and all but forgotten for over 60 years, became the drug of choice for a generation. &quot;Ecstasy Rising&quot; includes significant original reporting and first-time interviews with all the major players: the chemist who first reported the effects of Ecstasy; the California psychotherapists who treated patients with Ecstasy when it was still legal; the Dallas businessman who gave Ecstasy its name and turned it into a recreational drug; the drug enforcement officer who led the fight to make Ecstasy illegal; and the DJ who spread Rave and Ecstasy across America.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c9959e0716714bd9ff41a6d4a5087f3ec6efd9c","amp;dn":"Ecstasy+Rising+-+MDMA+Documentary+-+April+2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c9959e0716714bd9ff41a6d4a5087f3ec6efd9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,153,89,224,113,103,20,189,159,244,26,109,74,80,135,243,236,110,253,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
