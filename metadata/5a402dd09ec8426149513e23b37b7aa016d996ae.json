Airwave lived in Brussels until he was 20 years young, experimenting with computers and synthesizers at his home. After sending his first demo to Lightning Records - the home of the Bonzai label - , he became one of the artists of the new age in electronic music. After the first small success with PLG, North Pole, Montera and Magnetix he had his first breakthrough with the first release of Fire &amp; Ice. He decided to move to Antwerp to concentrate on his productional work. The first results were new releases for Fire &amp; Ice, Planisphere and Meridian. After that he evolved more &amp; more to become a real professional artist by producing both Airwave and Body-Shock. All that together with the launch of Bonzai UK made him an instant star in te progressive and trance scene. Besides all that he was also commissioned to make remixes for Yves Deruyter, Da Hool, Aurora, Solar Stone, Blue Alphabet,... Laurent has always essentially been influenced by the roots of electronic music, since the early beginning : from Kraftwerk to FSOL. Great producers as Jarre, Orbital, Oliver Lieb, BT,... are still taking his breath away. He defines his music as &quot;pure electronic dance music&quot; which is a result of many years of discovering and getting inspired by his music heroes, whom he calls &quot;the gods of technology&quot;\n\nThis album is amazing. It treads a line somewhere between uplifting (sans cheese) and progressive trance, and occasionally even ventures into progressive house territory. It all works, and is flowing and beautiful throughout.\n\nTracklist:\nNotice Of Eviction\t5:22\t\nPunjabi Child\t        10:05\t\nSunshine In Your Heart\t8:17\t\nCandy Of Life\t        9:00\t\nCoka's Song\t        11:07\t\nMind Repair Centre\t7:47\t\nUrban Toaureg\t        8:19\t\nMahebourg Express\t8:38\t\nBatignolles Blues\t8:30\t\nSave Me 2k8\t        9:47\t\nAbove The Sky 2k8\t7:38\t\nThe Division Bell 2k8\t8:35\t\nSunday Dark Firma\t8:46\t\nLightspeed 2k8\t        9:17\t\nSky Blues 2k8\t        8:47\t\nAngelica(Sagittaire Remix)10:25\t\nHaka For Peace\t        8:29\t\n\nDownload &amp; Enjoy...:)\nSeed as log as u can..\nCheers..:)\n\n\n\nBit Rate : 320 kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a402dd09ec8426149513e23b37b7aa016d996ae","amp;dn":"Airwave+-+Touareg+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a402dd09ec8426149513e23b37b7aa016d996ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,64,45,208,158,200,66,97,73,81,62,35,179,123,122,160,22,217,150,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
