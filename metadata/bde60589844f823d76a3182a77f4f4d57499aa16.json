She often performed and recorded with her sister Dolly, whose accompaniment on piano and portative organ created unique settings for her sister's plain, austere singing style.\n\nNo Roses is an album by Shirley Collins and the Albion Country Band. It was recorded at Sound Techniques, and Air Studios in London, in the summer of 1971. It was produced by Sandy Roberton and Ashley Hutchings (Shirley Collins' husband at the time). It was released in October 1971 on the Pegasus label.\n\nIt is very unusual to have 27 musicians and singers on an album of traditional folk songs. It happened because people simply dropped in during recording sessions and were asked to join in. At the time, the most unusual sound was the hurdy-gurdy, now heard much more frequently. &quot;The Murder of Maria Marten&quot; is broken into segments, with a heavy-rock alternating with Shirley's voice accompanied by a simple drone. Shirley had used a similar technique on &quot;One Night As I Lay on My Bed&quot; on &quot;Adieu To Old England&quot;.\n\n Personnel\nShirley Collins - vocals \nAshley Hutchings - electric bass guitar \nRichard Thompson - electric guitar, acoustic 12-string guitar \nMaddy Prior - vocals \nColin Ross - Northumbrian small pipes \nSimon Nicol - electric guitar \nLal and Mike Waterson - vocals \nRoyston Wood - vocals \nBarry Dransfield - fiddle \nDave Bland - concertina, hammer dulcimer \nIan Whiteman - piano \nRoger Powell - drums \nLol Coxhill - alto saxophone \nAlan Cave - bassoon \nTony Hall - melodeon \nDave Mattacks - sticks, drums \nDolly Collins - piano \nJohn Kirkpatrick - accordion \nNic Jones - vocals and fiddle \nTim Renwick - electric guitar, acoustic 12-string guitar \nFrancis Baines - hurdy-gurdy \nAlan Lumsden - ophicleide \nSteve Migden - French horn \nTrevor Crozier - Jew's harp \n[edit] Track listing\nClaudy Banks (Trad, from Ron and Bob Copper) \nLittle Gipsy Girl (Trad) \nBanks of The Bann (Trad) \nMurder of Maria Marten (Trad) \nVan Dieman's Land (Trad) \nJust As The Tide Was A'Flowing (Trad) \nWhite Hare (Trad) \nHal-An-Tow (Trad) \nPoor Murdered Woman (Trad) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde60589844f823d76a3182a77f4f4d57499aa16","amp;dn":"Shirley+Collins+Albion+Country+Band...No+Roses%281971%29cdrip%5BFLAC%5D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bde60589844f823d76a3182a77f4f4d57499aa16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,230,5,137,132,79,130,61,118,163,24,42,119,244,244,213,116,153,170,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
