The book is interspersed with lyrics and also includes photographs from Davies's own collection and the KinksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ archive.\n\nFrom his quintessentially English perspective, Davies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with candour, humour, and wit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ takes us on a very personal road trip through his life and storied career as a rock star, and reveals what music, fame and America really mean to him","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c487792c720b51646e4ec2a9c436d0540c7eb40","amp;dn":"Ray+Davies%2C+Americana+-+The+Kinks%2C+The+Road+and+The+Perfect+Riff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c487792c720b51646e4ec2a9c436d0540c7eb40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,72,119,146,199,32,181,22,70,228,236,42,156,67,109,5,64,199,235,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
