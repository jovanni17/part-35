Scoring Norman, an independent coming-of-age teen drama directed by Jonathan Segal, could have been an exercise in soul crushing melancholy, and while there is enough of that here to fill a bucket or two with string-induced tears, Bird knows when to pick up the pieces, put your sack on your back, and whistle your way back home. With the exception of an amiable pair of new originals and a cut from 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Noble Beast, Bird's contributions are primarily instrumental. Elsewhere, the Blow and Richard Swift offer up a ramshackle take on ABBA's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œS.O.S.,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Chad VanGaalen provides the stoic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRabid Bits of TimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from 2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Soft Airplane, and Wolf Parade downplays the histrionics of 2005ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Are a Runner and I am My FatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s SonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreduxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ version thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as spooky as it is subdued.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/norman-r2290519&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/norman-r2290519&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
