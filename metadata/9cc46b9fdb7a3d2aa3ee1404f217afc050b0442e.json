Anna is a pure gold baby with a delightful sunny nature. But as it becomes clear that Anna will not be a normal child, the book circles questions of responsibility, potential, even age, with Margaret DrabbleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characteristic intelligence, sympathy, and wit.\n\nDrabble once wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Family life itself, that safest, most traditional, most approved of female choices, is not a sanctuary; it is, perpetually, a dangerous place.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Told from the point of view of the group of mothers who surround Jess, The Pure Gold Baby is a brilliant, prismatic novel that takes us into that place with satiric verve, trenchant commentary, and a movingly intimate story of the unexpected transformations at the heart of motherhood.\n\nGenre: Fiction | Contemporary","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cc46b9fdb7a3d2aa3ee1404f217afc050b0442e","amp;dn":"The+Pure+Gold+Baby+by+Margaret+Drabble","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cc46b9fdb7a3d2aa3ee1404f217afc050b0442e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,196,107,159,219,122,61,42,163,238,20,4,242,23,175,192,80,176,68,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
