During the chorus, the camera spins around in circles to go along with the lines &quot;They are turning my head out&quot;. The video ends with butterfly-shaped confetti raining on the band, as happens when each chorus is played at live concerts.\n\n\nRipped By BunnyxD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cadaa66c3fae66a78ae2cb3b13420ccf63a658a","amp;dn":"Coldplay+-+Lovers+In+Japan+DvDrip+%5BHD%5D+%5BBunnyxD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cadaa66c3fae66a78ae2cb3b13420ccf63a658a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,173,170,102,195,250,230,106,120,174,44,179,177,52,32,204,246,58,101,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
