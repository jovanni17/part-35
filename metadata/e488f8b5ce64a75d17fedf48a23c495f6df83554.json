The film, inspired by the punk film Bom (Alaska), is about three girls, Pepi, Luci and Bom who live in Madrid during the punk era.\n\nAfter being raped by a policeman, Pepi vows revenge, persuading her friends to beat him up. However, they mistakenly attack the policeman&amp;#039;s twin brother and so Pepi tries again, persuading his masochistic wife, Luci, to leave him for teenager punk singer Bom, from Bom y Toni Group. The three of them explore the Madrid youth scene, attending parties, clubs, concerts and meeting outrageous characters. Luci returns to her husband once he finally satisifes her by beating her up and hospitalising her. Now alone, Pepi and Bom decide to move in together.\n\nAlmodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³var described the film, as a story about strong and vulnerable human beings, who devote themselves to passion, who suffer love and have fun. Spanish critics at that time took potshots at the film for its bathroom jokes, a humorous rape scene and weak cinematography. The Spanish newspaper El PeriÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³dico, described AlmodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³var as &quot;a stubbornly passionate defender of substandard movies&quot; while El PaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s praised it as a film that &quot;upturns with true daring the most respected taboos of our ridiculous society&quot;. Although still acknowledged as technically a poor film Pepi, Luci, Bom (as well AlmodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³var&amp;#039;s next film Laberinto de pasiones) is regarded as a document of La movida, the post-Franco punk scene that developed in Madrid.\n\nMy rip. includes the extra, &quot;An introduction to Pepi, Luci, Bom&quot; with JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Arroyo.\n\n~~~~~~ Pepi, Luci, Bom.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,102,155,776                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:18:10                \nFrame Count:....................................117230             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................672                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................416                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.615                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1731                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.248&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................136                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\naXXo sucks.
