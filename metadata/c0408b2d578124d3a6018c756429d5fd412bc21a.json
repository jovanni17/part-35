The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken about seven years, but Ben MarwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first proper full length has finally surfaced. The, Reading-born, singer/songwriter/folk hero has garnered quite a lot of attention whilst paying his dues in LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thriving folk scene. After the release of This Is Not What You Had Planned - a seven-track Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmini albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a split with Jim Lockey and Oxygen Thief, many are anticipating the arrival of BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first proper album.\n\nMarwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, often self deprecating, tales of life, love and loss tug on the heart strings and will resonate with almost everyone that listens. Combining the banal and macabre with fantastic turns of phrase, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear, that Ben is doing this because he loves to do it. At the same, time he proves that the art of songwriting is far from dead, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll play until my fingers hurt and grit my teeth trough every word, like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m the only introvert who wants to seize the day,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ being a prime example.\n-moonandbackmusic.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0408b2d578124d3a6018c756429d5fd412bc21a","amp;dn":"Ben+Marwood+-+Outside+There%26acute%3Bs+A+Curse+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0408b2d578124d3a6018c756429d5fd412bc21a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,64,139,45,87,129,36,211,166,1,140,117,100,41,213,253,65,43,194,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
