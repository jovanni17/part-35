Expect to hear a bitrate of roughly 128, since that roughly is the youtube standard.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1 - Malum - 3:14\n2 - Lo - 3:43\n3 - Sputnik - 2:50\n4 - Poison! - 7:46\n5 - Lay Down - 5:29\n6 - Easy Talk (Open Your Mouth) - 6:47\n7 - Machines Part I - 3:03\n8 - Machines Part II - 3:04\n9 - Bear - 6:07\n10 - Cleanse Me - 13:59\n11 - Last Breath - 7:02\n\n(Song times may vary slightly)\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nAll songs are in the mp3 format, and should be formatted for itunes.\n\nAs always, feel free to post requests and keep seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbd3e18bdf5fc01317c740c1bd41933ae246793d","amp;dn":"OBrother+Garden+Window+Full+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbd3e18bdf5fc01317c740c1bd41933ae246793d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,211,225,139,223,95,192,19,23,199,64,193,189,65,147,58,226,70,121,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
