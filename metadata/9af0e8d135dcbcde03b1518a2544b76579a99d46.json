(Imagine the look on my face when I heard that for the first time)\n\nMy idea is that this all occurred when the original ripper copied the audio books from a cassette player deck to a computer. The strange noises sound a lot like cassette players make, and the &amp;#039;Sugababes sample&amp;#039; is probably due to him pressing the tuner button which mixed in some live radio.\n\nI removed all of this for this torrent. You can remove the double files yourself if you already downloaded the Jedi Quest audio books from the previous torrent and the strange noises and Sugababes sample aren&amp;#039;t any real distraction.\n\n\n\nThe next Era, &amp;#039;Rebellion Era&amp;#039;, coming soon!\n\n\n\nI suggest that you bookmark my account http://thepiratebay.se/user/Starkiller20/ to stay up-to-date!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af0e8d135dcbcde03b1518a2544b76579a99d46","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Jedi+Quest+fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af0e8d135dcbcde03b1518a2544b76579a99d46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,240,232,209,53,220,188,222,3,177,81,138,37,68,183,101,121,169,157,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
