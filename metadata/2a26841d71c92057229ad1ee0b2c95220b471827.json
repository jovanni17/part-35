A great tool for creative work: support for tapeless production technologies, work with any format, multikamerny HD installation and much more. \n\nThe perfect combination of freedom of choice between different options of systems Avid Media Composer, which is best suited to the different projects: from an autonomous system with the software without additional hardware support to complete the hardware-software Avid Media Composer / Avid Digirtal Nonlinear Accelerator (Avid DNA) .\n\nInstallation of different formats on one timeline\n\nCombining in one time line HD, SD, DV, kinoformatov and permits, as well as Avid AVR and Meridien JFIF without rendering, transcoding, or re-digitizing. Editing DVCPRO HD and HDV without rendering. Multi-chamber installation in real-time HD, SD and DV video. Support 24p. Ability to capture 24p from IEEE-1394.\nAvid Media Composer is compatible with the environment Avid Unity and Avid Interplay.\n\nSupport for Sony XDCAM and Panasonic P2\n\nSave your time! Now, Avid Media Composer, you can carry out installation of the material with Sony XDCAM and Panasonic P2 without predzahvata. Support for Sony XDCAM includes the installation of copies of low-resolution, DV and IMX in high resolution.\n\nAvid DNxHD encoding\n\nIf you're working with HD, then you need the industry's first codec HD - Avid DNxHD, which allows you to keep the original quality HD images one by one with bandwidth comparable to that of SD. The new format Avid DNxHD delivers incredible quality of high resolution and maximum savings amount of disk space, providing an opportunity to work with the project in HD between several workstations. The flow rate of 145 Mbps (with 8-bit video in 4:2:2) and 220 Mbps (with 10-bit video in 4:2:2) with permission 720p and 1080p / i.\n\n10-bit color correction in real time\nAvid Media Composer has an effective color correction tools based on the technology of Avid Symphony. One click you can analyze the color and color correction of the entire sequence.\n\nSupport for Panasonic Varicam off-speed\nCapture and playback from cameras Panasonic Varicam.\n\nImage stabilization by using SteadyGlide\nNow you can automatically stabilize the footage, which, for whatever reasons, such as camera shake, become unfit for use in the project. As a result, you will greatly save your cost and time to work.\n\nFluidMotion\n\nWith FluidFilm you can create slow motion effects and &quot;fit-to-fill&quot; (stretch to the desired length) from any video using patented pixel morphing technology. Control the speed and position is performed by means of keyframes defining the curve. You can also make your 30i footage 24p or video form with function FluidFilm.\n\nSpectraMatte Keyer\n\nKeying can be a difficult task when working with 8mi bit format, such as DVCPRO HD. Now you can create high-quality keying and replay it in real time using a 16-bit technology SpectraGraph. Interactive environment helps an editor quickly find the key keingovy color, without wasting time on the method of &quot;spear&quot;.\n\nWorking with GOP\n\nMedia Composer system now can work with the structures of MPEG GOP, having size smaller than the standard 15 frames. This feature allows users to export HDV material without rendering the entire sequence.\n\nRecord 4-channel audio through a microphone\n4 channel audio recording straight to a time-line, without spending time on the capture and assembly of the material. During the dialogue or narration, you can record on a time line of several voices at once, which will greatly reduce the time for voiceovers.\n\nWatching videos in full screen mode via DVI output\nNow you can display SD and HD content in full screen mode on the LCD monitor, using a standard DVI connector.\n\nProfessional tools for working with film material\nEach system features built-in Media Composer Avid Film Composer metadata management. The seizure of material from 24p to 25p in real time, as well as automatic synchronization of video and audio sources. Also, when working with film material available additional metadata such as: Timecode, KeyKode, DPX, VXF and UNC.\n\nExcellent media management\nQuick and easy ordering, counting and localization of media sources.
