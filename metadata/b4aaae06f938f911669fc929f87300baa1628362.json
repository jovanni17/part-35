Much of this inspiration is increasingly drawn from amazing aspects of nature, including insects to plants to man in search of wisdom and insight. We are surrounded daily by scientific advancements that have become everyday items, simply because man is copying from Godâ€™s incredible creation, without acknowledging the Creator.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nRay Comfort is the best-selling author of more than 70 books, including The Evidence Bible (2002 Gold Medallion Book Awards finalist) and The Defender s Guide for Life s Toughest Questions published by Master Books.
