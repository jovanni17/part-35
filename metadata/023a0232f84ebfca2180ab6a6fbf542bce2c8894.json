His parents give him a short-wave radio so he can talk to his pals, but instead he sets up shop as pirate deejay Hard Harry, who becomes a hero to his peers while inspiring the wrath of the local high school principal. When one of Harry's listeners commits suicide and Harry- inspired chaos breaks out at the school, the authorities are called in to put a stop to Harry's broadcasts.\n\nCast:\n\nChristian Slater...Mark Hunter (Hard Harry)\nAnnie Ross...Loretta Creswood\nAndy Romano...Murdock\nScott Paulin...Brian Hunter\nMimi Kennedy...Marla Hunter\nAnthony Lucero...Malcolm Kaiser\nBilly Morrissette...Mazz Mazzilli\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:023a0232f84ebfca2180ab6a6fbf542bce2c8894","amp;dn":"Pump.Up.The.Volume.1990.DVDRip.XviD-Nile","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"023a0232f84ebfca2180ab6a6fbf542bce2c8894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,58,2,50,248,78,191,202,33,128,171,106,111,191,84,43,206,44,136,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
