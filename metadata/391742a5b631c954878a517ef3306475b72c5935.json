Over them, Jansen sings in a breathy soprano, taking octave leaps to emphasize emotional moments or just for variety. Her lyrics have an ingenuous charm, as she explores the romantic challenges of being a young woman. The words can be allusive and poetic, but on the most plainspoken track, &quot;Single Girls,&quot; she gets specific about making the transition out of a relationship that has gone wrong, addressing the absent ex-lover to explain how she's cut her hair, gone out for a drink with the guy down the hall, and dumped a bunch of pillows on the newly unused side of the bed, &quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“cause that's what single girls do.&quot; Of course, the details make the song all the more universal, and they help make it the best composition on a good first album. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nPLEASE SEED\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/08/06/laura-jansen/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:391742a5b631c954878a517ef3306475b72c5935","amp;dn":"Laura+Jansen+-+2009+-+Bells%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"391742a5b631c954878a517ef3306475b72c5935","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,23,66,165,182,49,201,84,135,138,81,126,243,48,100,117,183,44,89,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
