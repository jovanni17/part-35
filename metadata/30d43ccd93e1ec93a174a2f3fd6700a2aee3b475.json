After the brief and frankly unnecessary intro the first track is Victory. This track has the kind of heavier beat and rap talking which is similar to that is used in track 10 ÃƒÂ¢?? ItÃƒÂ¢??s all about the Benjamins. The next track ÃƒÂ¢?? Been around the world, has a much more upbeat tempo to it and really brings the album to life. Track 6, If I should die tonight (interlude), is more of a space filler than a track but it has a superb piano solo which is backed up by the words of Puffy. The nest landmark track is ItÃƒÂ¢??s all about the Benjamins. This track has a hard hitting beat and some good rhymes but lacks the vocal gymnastics which I think an artist such as Nas or Tupac would have given the song.\nThe following tracks are basically a showboat for the vocal talents which Puff used to spice up this album. People such as LilÃƒÂ¢?? Kim, Notorious B.I.G, Ginuwine, Twista, The Lox, Foxy Brown, India, 112 and Faith Evans. Of course 112 and Faith Evans appear on the excellent, IÃƒÂ¢??ll be missing you which is a remake of the police song every breathe you take. The final track on the album is a very fast paced and well-suited track called canÃƒÂ¢??t nobody hold me down. This track accompanies the rest of the album well and polishes off what is more of a compilation album than a solo one but is nonetheless a great album.\n\nArtist : Puff Daddy and Family\nAlbum : No Way Out\nLabel : Bad Boy\nGenre : HIP HOP\nRelease Date : 1997\nSize : 107MB\nAudio Format : MP3\nBit Rate : Variable\nTracker\n\n \t\nTRACK LISTING\n\n1.
