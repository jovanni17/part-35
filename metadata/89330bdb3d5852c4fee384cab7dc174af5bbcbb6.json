The theme in this one is less violent: it contrasts two sisters, one who devotes herself to love and material pleasures, one who decides to serve the nation. Kurosawa's early films were a bit like this.\n\nThis is totally silent (you will have to provide your own music), but the subtitles work very nicely, and the picture is a lot better than with Peach Blossom.\n\nAnother youtube reseed in flv format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89330bdb3d5852c4fee384cab7dc174af5bbcbb6","amp;dn":"National+Customs+%281935%29+%E5%9B%BD%E9%A3%8E+Ruan+Lingyu+Eng.+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89330bdb3d5852c4fee384cab7dc174af5bbcbb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,51,11,219,61,88,82,196,254,227,132,202,183,220,23,74,245,187,203,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
