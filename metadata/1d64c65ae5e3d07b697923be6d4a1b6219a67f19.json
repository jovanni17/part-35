Origins of a D-List Supervillain (D-List Supervillain #1)\r\n\r\nEven D-List Supervillains have to start somewhere.\r\n\r\nFollow Cal Stringelâ€™s misadventures as he climbs to the lowest levels of supervillany in the prequel to the smash hit, Confessions of a D-List Supervillain. Angry that he wouldnâ€™t be known as the engineer who made Ultraweaponâ€™s force blasters, Cal resigns to chase after a bigger, better paycheck.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Promethia Corporation isnâ€™t going to let him go that easily and sets out to make his life a living hell. Fed up at being pushed around by a company with an endless supply of lawyers and litigation, Cal sets out to build his own version of Ultraweaponâ€™s powered armor and take his revenge!\r\n\r\nWhat Cal doesnâ€™t count on is just how hard this is going to be.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, he will make both friends and enemies and discover how hard hitting rock bottom can feel. Whether Cal is trying to smooth talk his way out of the prison for supervillains, haggle with nefarious employers over the price of his inventions, or battle with the Gulf Coast Guardians, heâ€™s in for one wild ride!\r\n\r\nHeâ€™ll need to learn that when money is tight that everything has a price â€“ from the cost of making weapons for a psychotic speedster to how much to charge for taking the blame for a drunken rampage through Las Vegas.\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n2. Confessions of a D-List Supervillain (D-List Supervillain #2)\r\n\r\nâ€œBeing a supervillain means never having to say youâ€™re sorry â€¦ Unless itâ€™s to the judge or the parole board. Even then, you donâ€™t really have to. Itâ€™s not like itâ€™s going to change the outcome or anything.â€\r\n\r\nThose are the words of Calvin Matthew Stringel, better known as Mechani-Cal. Heâ€™s a sarcastic, down on his luck armored villain. Follow his exploits as he gets swept up in a world domination scheme gone wrong and ends up working for this weak willed, mercy loving heroes. Immerse yourself in his epic battles and see what itâ€™s like to be an outsider looking in at a world that few have ever experienced.\r\n\r\nClimb into Calâ€™s battlesuit and join him on his journey. Will he avoid selling out his principles for a paycheck and a pardon? Can he resist the camaraderie of being on a super team? Does he fall prey to the ample charms of the beautiful Olympian Aphrodite? How will he survive the jealous schemes of Ultraweapon, who wears armor so powerful it makes Calâ€™s look like a museum piece?\r\n\r\nSee the world of â€œrighteous do-gooders&quot; through the eyes of someone who doesnâ€™t particularly care for them.\r\n\r\nAnd remember - Losing an argument with a group of rioters isnâ€™t a good excuse to start lobbing tear gas indiscriminately at them. Youâ€™ve only got so many rounds and itâ€™s going to be a long day, so make sure you get as many as possible with each one.\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\n3. Secrets of a D-List Supervillain (D-List Supervillain #3)\r\n\r\nCal Stringel may be dead to the world at large, but a select few know that he's still alive and in control of the most powerful suit of battle armor ever created. He's part of a rogue super team taking the world by storm and changing the dynamic for both heroes and villains alike. With change comes resistance and those holding control and power are not ready to just hand it over without a fight.\r\n\r\nFor the former D-List Supervillain, itâ€™s time to break out the spare synthmuscle, charge the massive railgun pistol, and bring the pain. With his new team, he thinks he can take on the world, but is Cal biting off more than he can chew? He must deal with sanctioned hero teams and power mad bureaucrats on one side and the major supervillains of his world on the other.\r\n\r\nAs Cal and his allies ready themselves to face friend and foe, he will also have to deal with his relationship with Stacy Mitchell, also known as the Olympian, Aphrodite. Separated for over a year, theyâ€™ve only just reunited and are faced with the prospect of being on opposite sides of the coming conflict. Can they find enough common ground between the secrets and half-truths to sustain their fledgling relationship, or are they doomed like the last time to crash and burn?\r\n\r\nFind out in Secrets of a D-List Supervillain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d64c65ae5e3d07b697923be6d4a1b6219a67f19","amp;dn":"Jim+Bernheimer+-+D-List+Supervillain+%5BBooks+1-3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d64c65ae5e3d07b697923be6d4a1b6219a67f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,100,198,90,229,227,208,123,105,121,35,190,109,74,27,98,25,166,127,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
