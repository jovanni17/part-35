The stories you can hear are interpretations composed by the most interesting figures in Polish beat-making (some already well known while others only now rising to fame). Through sound, they narrate the ups and downs of human emotion, from cases as significant as true love to those as mundane as a fling. This New Beat saga of peculiar affairs of the heart aims at creating a cross-section of forward-looking producers on the Polish scene who are both thinking and producing in the future. Finally, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a subjective response to the question as to which way is the way in a world of club flirt these days. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the way to the heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa27fb28e25c13b5ef061c6b2e5b77695b4731c6","amp;dn":"FLIRTINI+%26quot%3BHeartbreaks+%26amp%3B+Promises%26quot%3B+2014+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa27fb28e25c13b5ef061c6b2e5b77695b4731c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,39,251,40,226,92,19,181,239,6,28,107,46,91,119,105,91,71,49,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
