For Cletus Frade and his colleagues in the OSS, it should be time to pack up, but they have far more important things to do.\n\nIn the closing months of the war, the United States made a secret deal with the head of German intelligenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Soviet section. In exchange for a treasure trove of intelligence, including the identity of the Soviet spies in the American atomic bomb program, his people would be spirited to safety. If word got out, all hell would break loose, and the United States would lose some of its best sources, not to mention its most valuable secrets.\n\nIt is up to Frade and company to keep them all safe. But some people have other ideas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79fdd5d2b05bcef27e01ba3d12dfdfae485ee8d8","amp;dn":"WEB+Griffin+-+Empire+and+Honor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79fdd5d2b05bcef27e01ba3d12dfdfae485ee8d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,253,213,210,176,91,206,242,126,1,186,61,18,223,223,174,72,94,232,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
