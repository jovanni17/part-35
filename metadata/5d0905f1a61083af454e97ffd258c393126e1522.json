During her bumbling quest to unveil the truth, she crosses paths with Terry and Geldof, and together they set out to escape a quarantined Britain with the evidence and vital data that could unlock a cure for the virus.\n\nStanding in the way are rampaging hordes of animals, a ruthless security agent and an army ready to shoot anybody with a case of the sniffles on the off-chance the virus has mutated.\n\nThree losers. Overwhelming odds. A single outcome: the world is screwed.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Isis Audio Books; Unabridged edition (October 1, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1445023377\nISBN-13: 978-1445023373\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
