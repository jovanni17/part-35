Marc Silvestri and David Wohl prove themselves a formidable team once again!\n\nCyberforce #1\nThe team is no more, and Ripclaw has become an evil, twisted reflection of himself. Only Velocity, Cyblade and Ballistic can hope to stop Ripclaw, as they lure him into a final, bloody confrontation with a shocking outcome! Meanwhile, an alien menace sets its sights on Earth... \n\nCyberforce #2\nThe evil Ripclaw has stalked the remaining members of the team, trapping them in Cyblade's ancestral mansion with the intention of bringing a brutal end to the team. But when a second Ripclaw appears, it's time for a bloody, no-holds-barred battle of epic proportions. It's Ripclaw vs. Ripclaw, and no matter who wins, the rest of Cyberforce isn't likely to survive! And if that weren't enough, the mysterious, space-borne threat introduced last issue draws closer and closer to Earth...\n\nCyberforce #3\nCyberforce must live again...or Earth dies! Having barely survived last issue's onslaught, Ripclaw, Cyblade, Velocity and Ballistic have learned the true nature of the threat descending toward Earth, a threat that has ties to the very origins of Cyberforce itself. Unless it's stopped, Earth is doomed. The lone hope of survival rests with a mysterious figure from Cyberforce's past?but even if they can find him, will he be friend or foe?\n\nCyberforce #4\nCyberforce was born thanks to having the DNA of an alien race spliced into their genes. Now the team may very well die at the hands of those same god-like aliens! As the alien mothership nears earth, Cyberforce must be at full strength to have any chance of winning the coming battle, and that means finding powerhouse Impact and convincing him to rejoin the team. Of course, first Ripclaw and his teammates must survive an aerial dogfight, and face off against deadly mechanized warriors.\n\nCyberforce #5\nThe first story arc of the new Cyberforce revs toward its conclusion, but the reunion might be over before it's barely begun. Trapped on the alien mothership as it nears Earth, Cyberforce must find a way to defeat the super-powered aliens who served as their genetic &quot;parents.&quot; Should the team fail, it means certain death for not only them, but for planet Earth as well!\n\nCyberforce #6\nThe first story arc roars to its climax as the reunited Cyberforce battles a god-like alien race intent on destroying the Earth! At least one member of the team won't survive the battle. Who will it be? Ripclaw? Velocity? Impact? Heatwave? And will the sacrifice of one be enough to save the lives of the others? Find out who lives and who dies as the acclaimed team of Ron Marz and Pat Lee conclude the first unforgettable storyline of the all-new Cyberforce.\n\nCyberforce: Hunter Killer #1-5 (2009-2010) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7806806/Cyberforce__Hunter_Killer__1-5_(2009-2010)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7806806/Cyberforce__Hunter_Killer__1-5_(2009-2010)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:926ef061d945b42e043641fe84a46ce73ebb3e13","amp;dn":"Cyberforce+%230-6+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"926ef061d945b42e043641fe84a46ce73ebb3e13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,110,240,97,217,69,180,46,4,54,65,254,132,164,108,231,62,187,62,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
