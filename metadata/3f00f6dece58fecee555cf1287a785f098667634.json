They are serving bite-size mini mealsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½tapas, bar snacks, antipasti, skewered vegetablesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½whenever they entertain. Simple Italian Snacks shows how to plan a menu for any gathering in the informal yet chic way that Italians have mastered. Here are recipes appropriate for an afternoon by the pool, a fireside get-together with friends, an intimate dinner for two, or a party for a crowd. The dishes, which can be served as hors d'oeuvres or presented as a meal, are easy to prepare, and many can be made ahead of time.\n\nThe authors of the wildly successful Simple Italian Sandwiches include all-new bruschetta, tramezzini, and panini as well as classic Italian snacks such as Baked Eggs in Tomato Sauce and Rice Balls. They show us how to make any party an event and even include sparkly cocktails. The recipes in Simple Italian Snacks are quick yet incredibly sophisticated and, as always, delicious.\n\nBook Cover:\nhttp://www.image-upload.net/images/lh7pbeh3weqzibohjy23.jpg\n\nPlz Seed...\n\nThnXX...\n\nmAnaV...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f00f6dece58fecee555cf1287a785f098667634","amp;dn":"Simple.Italian.Snacks+%28mAnaV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f00f6dece58fecee555cf1287a785f098667634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,0,246,222,206,88,254,206,229,85,207,18,135,167,133,240,152,102,118,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
