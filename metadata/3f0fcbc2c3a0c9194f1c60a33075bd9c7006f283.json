Bazan (pronounced &quot;buh-zahn&quot;) was the lead singer and creative force behind the now-defunct band Pedro the Lion and was the lead singer of Headphones, a band he formed out of his interest in synthesizers. In early 2006, he began performing and recording solo. Bazan is currently touring the United States with a full band for the first time in almost five years.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bazan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bazan&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrange Negotiations is David Bazan's second full length studio album. It is set to be released on May 24, 2011. The recording of the album began in early November 2010, and was funded by allowing fans to purchase a pre-order of the album along with an exclusive T-shirt priced to allow sufficient money for Bazan to take time off of touring.Recording and mixing of the album were finished December 24, 2010, and it was subsequently mastered by long time collaborator T.W. Walsh.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Negotiations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Negotiations&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
