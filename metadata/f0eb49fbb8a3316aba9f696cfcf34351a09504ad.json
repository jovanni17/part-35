A city that thrived for 2000 years during the time that saw the birth of Western civilisation. An international team of experts uses the latest technology to investigate the site and digitally raise it from the seabed, to reveal the secrets of Pavlopetri. \n\nLed by underwater archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson, the team use the latest in cutting-edge science and technology to prise age-old secrets from the complex of streets and stone buildings that lie less than five metres below the surface. State-of-the-art CGI helps to raise the city from the seabed revealing, for the first time in 3,500 years, how Pavlopetri would once have looked and operated. \n\nJon Henderson is leading this ground-breaking project in collaboration with a team from the Hellenic Ministry of Culture, and Nic Flemming, the man whose hunch led to the intriguing discovery of Pavlopetri in 1967. Also working alongside the archaeologists are a team from the Australian Centre for Field Robotics, who aim to take underwater archaeology into the 21st century. \n\nThe team scour the sea floor for any artefacts that have eroded from the sands. The site is littered with thousands of fragments, each providing valuable clues to the everyday lives of the people of Pavlopetri. From the buildings to the trade goods to the everyday tableware, every artefact provides a window into a long-forgotten world. \n\nTogether these precious relics provide us with a unique insight into a time when Pavlopetri would have been at its height, showing us what life was like in this distant age and revealing how this city marks the start of Western civilisation.\n\nCredits\nNarrator\nPhilip Glenister\nParticipant\nJon Henderson\nDirector\nPaul Olding\nProducer\nPaul Olding\nExecutive Producer\nGary Hunter\n\nFormat : Matroska at 4261 Kbps\nLength : 2 GiB for 58mn 49s 40ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC\nAspect : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AAC\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nText #0 : UTF-8\nLanguage : gre\n\nText #1 : UTF-8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0eb49fbb8a3316aba9f696cfcf34351a09504ad","amp;dn":"BBC+City+Beneath+the+Waves+Pavlopetri-HDTV.greek+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0eb49fbb8a3316aba9f696cfcf34351a09504ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,235,73,251,184,163,49,106,186,159,105,108,252,243,67,81,160,149,4,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
