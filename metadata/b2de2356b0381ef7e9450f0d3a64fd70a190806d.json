The Complete Guide to Punks on Film \nby Zack Carlson and Bryan Connolly\nFantagraphics | December 2010 | ISBN-10: 1606993631 | scanned PDF | 600 pages | 100 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Destroy-Movies-Complete-Guide-Punks/dp/1606993631&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Destroy-Movies-Complete-Guide-Punks/dp/1606993631&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe most dazzlingly insane film reference book of all time, Destroy All Movies!!! is an informative, hilarious and impossibly complete guide to every appearance of a punk (or new waver!) to hit the screen in the 20th Century. This wildly comprehensive release contains A-to-Z coverage of over 1100 feature films from around the world, as well as dozens of exclusive interviews with the cast/creators of crucial titles like Repo Man, Return of the Living Dead, The Decline of Western Civilization and Valley Girl. Also examined are several hundred prime examples of straight-to-VHS slasher trash, Brooklyn skid row masterpieces, Filipino breakdancing fairytales, no-budget apocalyptic epics and movies that shouldn't even have been released, many of which have never been written about. Plus hundreds of eyeball-smashing stills and posters, many in full color!\nDestroy All Movies!!! nails down decades of insanity with superhuman research, vicious precision and electrically charged stills and images, and is the first and final definitive armchair roadmap to punk and new wave on celluloid. Five years in the making, this pulse-bursting monument to lowbrow cultural obsession is a must for all film fanatics, music maniacs, anti-fashion mutants, '80s nostalgists, sleazoids, cop-killers and spazzmatics!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2de2356b0381ef7e9450f0d3a64fd70a190806d","amp;dn":"Destroy+All+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2de2356b0381ef7e9450f0d3a64fd70a190806d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,222,35,86,176,56,30,247,233,69,15,13,58,100,253,112,161,144,128,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
