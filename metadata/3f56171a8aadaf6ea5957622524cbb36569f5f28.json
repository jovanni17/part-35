Filled with beautiful pop melodies, the Supernaturals' music is pretension-free and uninhibited; they are strictly a pop band. It Doesn't Matter Anymore is a brilliant debut of upbeat, sparkling pop singles and precious ballads, including the five stellar singles, &quot;Smile,&quot; &quot;Lazy Lover,&quot; &quot;The Day After Yesterday's Man,&quot; &quot;Free to Land&quot; and &quot;Love Has Passed Away.&quot; The punkish shuffle of &quot;Stammer,&quot; and the expository drumming of the infectious opener, &quot;Please Be Gentle with Me,&quot; are amongst the highlights of this album where dips in quality are few. Each track on the disc feels like a classic summertime anthem made for backyard barbecues and trips to the beach. It Doesn't Matter Anymore contains only a few slow spots -- most notably on the ballads, which are (for the most part) less inspired than the more uptempo tracks. While some of the lyrics and songs also have a tendency to become silly at times, It Doesn't Matter Anymore is an incredibly accomplished and compelling debut.
