In the distant future, Earth's natural resources have been depleted, and as an off-world prospector it's your job to travel to alien planets and scour them for valuable materials. These can be refined and shipped back to Earth in return for cash, or crafted into new components to augment your fleet. The rarest resources unlock the best equipment, so expand your territory and capture enemy bases, to secure your position on each planet.\r\nBuild crazy vehicles out of modular blocks! Hunt down enemies, shoot parts off them and scavenge the remains, to make your vehicle harder, better, stronger and faster.\r\nBuild anything you can imagine! Heavy battle tanks? Yes. Fast scout vehicles? Indeed. Flying carpet bombers? Why not? Simply drag and snap new blocks onto your creation, and get straight back into the fray!\r\nDrag-and-drop building and scavenging of blocks.\r\nAbility to build land vehicles, fixed turrets, hovercraft, rockets and aeroplanes.\r\nModular refining/crafting system using special production blocks.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: Intel Core2 Duo T7600 @ 2.33GHz or AMD Athlon 64 FX-60 Dual Core\r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: nVidia GeForce 520M or Intel HD 4000\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0\r\nStorage: 1 GB available space\r\nMouse, Keyboard\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5 750 @ 2.67GHz or AMD Phenom II X4 945\r\nMemory: 6 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: nVidia GeForce GTX 260 or ATI Radeon HD 5670\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0\r\nStorage: 2 GB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:259213e80d01b2a328d3bf1692f05e4c2affa91f","amp;dn":"TerraTech+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"259213e80d01b2a328d3bf1692f05e4c2affa91f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,146,19,232,13,1,178,163,40,211,191,22,146,240,94,76,42,255,169,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
