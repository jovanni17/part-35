He avoided the question, and told me heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d give me $20 if I let him shit all over my chest. As a starving musician, the chance for a meal and $20 was just too much to pass up, so I accepted.\nThe man handed me the money, and told me to follow him home. I know, I should have just run off with the money right there. I guess IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just too nice. The man walked into his house, and I was surprised to see a child, looking about the age of four, sitting on the couch, listening to gangster rap and watching hardcore gay pornography on a bigscreen TV. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Daddy!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The boy yelled, as he jumped up to hug the man. He noticed me, and stopped. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is this the poopy man?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yes, boy, this is the poopy man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The boy look thrilled. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Can I watch?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He asked, grinning, revealing his missing teeth. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Of course you can, son.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Said the man. The boy looked overjoyed.\nAt this point, I started getting a little concerned, but hey, it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t my problem. The man took me to his room, and asked me to lie down on the bed. I did so. The boy sat on a chair and watched, excitedly. The man took off my shirt, which felt pretty good, I must admit. He then took off his pants, which, of course, I looked away from, while his son watched, enthralled. The man kneeled over my chest as he shat on me. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something in his closet. Ã¢â‚¬Å“What is that?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I asked the man. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh, nothing, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry about it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The man said, straining to get his moneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth. The boy, however, seemed concerned. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Daddy?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He asked, Ã¢â‚¬Å“did the poopy man find mommy?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nNow I was more than a little concerned, and asked to be excused from the proceedings. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh no you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the man said, as he reached under his bed to grab a shotgun. Terrified, I threw the man off me and ran out of the room. The man shot at me as I passed by, but accidentally shot his child in the leg. More concerned with his child than with me, the man let me go. I emerged from the house, shirtless and covered in human feces, as police showed up to identify the shots. They arrested me. Dicks.\nA few hours later, I was back at home, exhausted. I took a shower, and made these songs. Hopefully this EP makes you feel like you have poop on your chest, too.\nLove,\nLash.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55ced51c65c2e2cefdc6c6d75f0493cbce168d70","amp;dn":"Lash+-+%28s%29crap%28s%29+%28Ryan+Hughes%29+%2Fprofile.php%3Fid%3D1405821672","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55ced51c65c2e2cefdc6c6d75f0493cbce168d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,206,213,28,101,194,226,206,253,198,198,215,95,4,147,203,206,22,141,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
