X-O Manowar was briefly relaunched, but did not last too long as Acclaim itself filed for bankruptcy due to their financial woes as a result of mismanaging their video games department. These 21 issues are notably for the work of Mark Waid, who would make a major name for himself as an independent writer and for his work with Marvel. I have also included the rare Iron Man crossover, Heavy Metal, penned by Fabian Nicieza. Along with my Volume 1 torrent, this is all X-O Manowar material published prior to the recent Valiant relaunch. Thanks to the original scanners and uploaders, whoever you may be lol. Please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d22abbf207d9ae5e5f88b7f38b761901aade850b","amp;dn":"X-O+Manowar+v2+01-21+%2B+Ex+%281996-1998%2C+Acclaim+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d22abbf207d9ae5e5f88b7f38b761901aade850b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,42,187,242,7,217,174,94,95,136,183,243,139,118,25,1,170,222,133,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
