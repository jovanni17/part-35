It really is Microsoft's fault for the autorun.inf security hole.  Microsoft Security Essentials detects the virus, but Linux is still the best computer security solution.\n\nThe exe was on the root of the flash drive, and the vmx file was hidden in the recycle bin on the drive.  I renamed them to *.vir so you don't accidentally run them.  Use a virtual machine or sandbox if you want to run them\n\nWin32/Conficker.C","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383d6c7799103e0b9d12a3ccb1ecefa20cb8e7e4","amp;dn":"conficker.C+virus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383d6c7799103e0b9d12a3ccb1ecefa20cb8e7e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,61,108,119,153,16,62,11,157,18,163,204,177,236,239,162,12,184,231,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
