The second edition of this best-selling book presents solutions to many of the practical problems involved in the analysis and design of tanks. It grew, in part, from the author's work as a member of the American Concrete Institute technical committee on circular pre-stressed structures. Containing six new chapters, it will be an immediately productive design aid in any civil engineering design office. Part 1 provides an analysis of circular storage tanks examining design, methods of analysis and potential problems. Part 2 contains practical design tables","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af02595be978d6dd042571150d9fbdf5943223a2","amp;dn":"Circular+Storage+Tanks+and+Silos+2nd+ed+-+A.Ghali","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af02595be978d6dd042571150d9fbdf5943223a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,2,89,91,233,120,214,221,4,37,113,21,13,159,189,245,148,50,35,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
