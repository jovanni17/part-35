This time we meet Hollywood star Justin (Cory Monteith) who welcomes his do-gooder brother Rory (Dustin Milligan) to his beach pad. Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jerry (Benjamin Ratner), a schizophrenic whose constantly changing moods stress out his sister Louise (Gabrielle Miller). Next, the psychologically fragile Maggie (Camille Sullivan) resents her stepsister Nikki (Amanda Crew), a spunky aspiring actress, for a laundry list of reasons. Nevertheless, the two wind up taking a bizarre road trip to L.A. in pursuit of NikkiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breakthrough role: Fembra the Huntress. Watch for Sarah (Kacey Rohl), a fiery-tempered teen prone to verbally attacking her mom (Gabrielle Rose) who has another daughter (Leena Manro) from a fling years ago at an ashram in India. The story jumps between the four sibling pairs and deals with movie stardom, schizophrenia, artistic ambition, poverty, racial divides and much, much more.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1816642/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1816642/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Comedy\niMDB Rating: 5,1/10 from 151 users\nDirector: Carl Bessai\nStarring: Cory Monteith, Dustin Milligan, Amanda Crew\nRelease Title: Sisters And Brothers 2011 BRRip X264-PLAYNOW\nRelease Date: 11.09.2013\nVideoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..: x264 CRF19\nAudioÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..: English LC-AAC 2 channels 48.0 KHz\nResolution: 720Ãƒâ€”400\nSizeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦: 614MB\nRuntimeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦: 1h 26mn\nSource Used: Sisters And Brothers 2011 720p BluRay x264-IGUANA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f1c97cfdb10b2f5b73efa307666c652f8b14bf8","amp;dn":"Sisters+And+Brothers+2011+BRRip+X264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f1c97cfdb10b2f5b73efa307666c652f8b14bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,28,151,207,219,16,178,245,183,62,250,48,118,102,198,82,248,177,75,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
