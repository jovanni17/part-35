Walking Pandas strip.  The first installment of The Pandas Show was released on Friday to give you a taste, because we like helping our friends and collaborators. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really the extent of ThrillbentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement, so when you see it and laugh, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t credit us; credit those two lunatics and their sketchy friends, none of whom we can understand because they always speak French around us.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
