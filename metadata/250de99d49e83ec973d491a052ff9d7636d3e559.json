He plays James K. Howard, a respected college anthropology professor and grandson of a millionaire industrialist. It got poor ratings and a fair amount of bad reviews, but I'm finding it amusing.  This is another of several one-season early 1970s Warner Brothers TV shows along with &quot;Nichols&quot; and &quot;Search&quot; to get a DVD release in recent years.\n\nThe actors playing James' kids and grandchild are bland, but his wife Julie Adams was perfect!  I always liked both of them, but it's hard to accept that Julie -- who was only 45 at the time, could have been married to Jim's character for over 30 years !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:250de99d49e83ec973d491a052ff9d7636d3e559","amp;dn":"THE+JIMMY+STEWART+SHOW+--+By+Way+of+Introduction+%28+pilot+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"250de99d49e83ec973d491a052ff9d7636d3e559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,13,233,157,73,232,62,201,115,212,145,160,82,255,157,118,54,211,229,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
