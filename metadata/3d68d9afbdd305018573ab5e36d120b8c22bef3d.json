Before Brian joined the Navy he totaled it, abused it and used it for parts. But now that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older and wiser, Brian wants a second chance with the car. The Chevelle lies in pieces in his garage, torn down to the chassis, and it will take a miracle to get her up and running. She needs a full interior rebuild, new fuel lines, and a laundry list of details to even get her on the road. \n\nWEB-DL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d68d9afbdd305018573ab5e36d120b8c22bef3d","amp;dn":"Garage+Squad+S01E4+Shell+of+A+Chevelle+2kimik2.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d68d9afbdd305018573ab5e36d120b8c22bef3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,104,217,175,189,211,5,1,133,115,171,94,54,209,32,184,194,43,239,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
