This is a strange/unique album.  One would figure that it's hard to go \n\n\nwrong with Oscar and Joe duets.  Both have total mastery of their instruments.\n\n\nThis record goes far afield with Oscar playing an antique keyboard which sounds like \n\n\na zither (watch the movie &quot;THE THIRD MAN&quot; with Orson Welles to understand better\n\n\nwhat I'm talking about).   The results are pleasant and quaint and very enjoyable\n\n\nbut this is not yer typical cooking funky Oscar Peterson album.\n\n\nApproach with caution.  If you can't dig it..blame Oscar and Joe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5523b576df07c32458746b0d8c32ba3e77fdf99b","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson%2FJoe+Pass%3B+Porgy+and+Bess+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5523b576df07c32458746b0d8c32ba3e77fdf99b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,35,181,118,223,7,195,36,88,116,107,13,140,50,186,62,119,253,249,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
