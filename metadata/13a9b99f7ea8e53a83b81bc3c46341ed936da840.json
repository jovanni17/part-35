Biologists, astrophysicists, biochemists, geoscientists and space scientists share this exciting mission of revealing the origin and commonality of life in the Universe. The members of the different disciplines are used to their own terminology and technical language. In the interdisciplinary environment many terms either have redundant meanings or are completely unfamiliar to members of other disciplines.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Astrobiology serves as the key to a common understanding. Each new or experienced researcher and graduate student in adjacent fields of astrobiology will appreciate this reference work in the quest to understand the big picture. The carefully selected group of active researchers contributing to this work and the expert field editors intend for their contributions, from an internationally comprehensive perspective, to accelerate the interdisciplinary advance of astrobiology.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 1897 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st edition. edition (July 31, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 364211279X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642112799","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13a9b99f7ea8e53a83b81bc3c46341ed936da840","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Astrobiology+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13a9b99f7ea8e53a83b81bc3c46341ed936da840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,169,185,159,126,168,229,58,131,184,27,195,196,99,65,237,147,109,168,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
