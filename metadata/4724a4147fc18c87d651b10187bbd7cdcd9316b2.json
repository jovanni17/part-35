Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the Mastretta MXT, but worries about the repercussions of a comment he made in a previous episode about Mexico, the sports car's country of manufacture. Plus, three high-performance hatchbacks are driven with gusto around the test track, and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton - who has switched from McLaren to Mercedes for the 2013 season - gets a second chance to smash the lap record.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4724a4147fc18c87d651b10187bbd7cdcd9316b2","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+S19E04+-+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4724a4147fc18c87d651b10187bbd7cdcd9316b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,36,164,20,127,193,140,135,214,81,177,1,135,187,215,205,205,147,22,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
