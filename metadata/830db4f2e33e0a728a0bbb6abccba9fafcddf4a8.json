Focusing on action extremization, the book develops the structure and predictions of general relativity by analogy with familiar physical systems. Topics ranging from classical field theory to minimal surfaces and relativistic strings are covered in a homogeneous manner. Nearly 150 exercises and numerous examples throughout the textbook enable students to test their understanding of the material covered. A tensor manipulation package to help students overcome the computational challenge associated with general relativity is available on a site hosted by the author\n\nHardcover: 384 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (August 1, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521762456\nISBN-13: 978-0521762458","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:830db4f2e33e0a728a0bbb6abccba9fafcddf4a8","amp;dn":"Advanced+Mechanics+and+General+Relativity+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"830db4f2e33e0a728a0bbb6abccba9fafcddf4a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,13,180,242,227,62,10,114,138,11,187,106,188,203,169,250,252,221,244,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
