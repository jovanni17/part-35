One man, Nebezial Asheri, driven by the deaths of his wife and daughters, will attempt to reclaim that magic and bring his loved ones back to life. The forces of an entire city, Paladia, will rise to oppose him, but his greatest foes will be a ragtag band of an outcast wizard, a dragonrider, and their allies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a731b4933e558730d07170b224ca57353995fc7","amp;dn":"Ravine+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a731b4933e558730d07170b224ca57353995fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,115,27,73,51,229,88,115,13,7,23,11,34,76,165,115,83,153,95,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
