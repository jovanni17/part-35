While he has recorded some terrible albums -- and he would admit that freely -- Stewart was once rock &amp; roll's best interpretive singer as well as an accomplished songwriter, creating a raw combination of folk, rock, blues, and country that sounded like no other folk-rock or country-rock material. Instead of finding the folk in rock, he found how folk rocked like hell on its own. After Stewart became successful, he began to lose the rootsier elements of his music, yet he remained a superb singer, even as he abandoned his own artistic path in favor of following pop trends.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Maggie May\n02.You Wear It Well\n03.(I Know) I'm Losing You\n04.Country Comforts\n05.Every Picture Tells A Story\n06.Angel\n07.Gasoline Alley\n08.It's All Over Now\n09.Reason To Believe\n10.True Blue\n11.Twistin' The Night Away\n12.Handbags &amp; Gladrags\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce7d15320a94ba12529d1cb2119781f4e508579d","amp;dn":"Rod+Stewart+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%281999%29320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce7d15320a94ba12529d1cb2119781f4e508579d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,125,21,50,10,148,186,18,82,157,28,178,17,151,129,244,229,8,87,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
