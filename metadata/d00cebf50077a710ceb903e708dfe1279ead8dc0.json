You sailed from England expecting to join a struggling colony on the coast of\nVirginia. Instead, you find only ghosts and mysteries. What catastrophe blighted the land and\ndrained it of color and life? Where are the settlers and tribes who lived here? And who is the\nstrange, silent woman in red who aids you from afar?\n\nClue by clue, you must piece together the story of what befell this doomed settlement and find\na way to set things right. You will be hunted by corrupted Conquistadors and ravening shadows\nas you explore an expansive wilderness in order to trace the brief, tragic history of the colony and\nsearch for survivors.\n\n******************************\n*       Key Features:       \n******************************\n\n*  Chart your own course through an untamed wilderness teeming with danger and discovery.\n\n* Unravel the colonyÃƒâ€ s many mysteries by gathering clues and awakening the memories of the dreaming dead.\n\n* Build up an arsenal of early 17th century weaponry including muskets, bows, crossbows, and throwing axes.\n\n* Collect untold treasures hidden in the wilds by the colonists for reasons you will come to understand in time.\n\n*\n\n*****************************\n*     Install Notes:       \n*****************************\n\n1.

Play\n\n\n********************************\n*     Additional Notes:       \n********************************\n* Early Access Status\nThe initial Early Access release features an introductory area and one large region to explore. Most of the weapon\ncategories are represented, including shortbows, longbows, crossbows, muskets, pistols, and the throwing axe.\nWhile you will only begin to scratch the surface of the story at this stage, you will get a good idea of the mechanics\nthrough which it is revealed.\n\nAs this is an alpha product, the content is still a work in progress and there are likely to be bugs and unfinished assets.\n\n* Update Plans\nIn the coming days and weeks, we will open up new areas to explore that feature new enemies, weapons, gameplay\nmechanics, characters, and mysteries. Your feedback will help us to refine existing gameplay and prioritize upcoming\nfeatures and fixes, so please let us know what you think on the forums!\n\nNote that because we will be adding features on a regular basis, some updates may require you to start a new game\nin order to experience the changes. Turn off Automatic Updates for Betrayer in your Steam Library if you prefer to stay\nwith the current version and update manually later.\n\n* System Requirements:\n\n   Minimum:\n       OS: Windows Vista\n       Processor: 3.0 GHz dual core or better\n       Memory: 3 GB RAM\n       Graphics: DirectX 9 compatible with 1GB video RAM or better (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti/AMD Radeon HD 6870)\n       DirectX: Version 9.0c\n       Hard Drive: 4 GB available space\n       Sound Card: Windows compatible stereo sound card\n\n   Recommended:\n       OS: Windows Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8\n       Processor: 2.4 GHz quad core or better (enhanced for multi-core processors)\n       Memory: 4 GB RAM\n       Graphics: DirectX 9 compatible with 2GB video RAM or better (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 Ti/AMD Radeon HD 7950)\n       DirectX: Version 9.0c\n       Hard Drive: 4 GB available space\n       Sound Card: Windows compatible stereo sound card\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00cebf50077a710ceb903e708dfe1279ead8dc0","amp;dn":"Betrayer+Early+Access+Cracked-P2PGAMES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00cebf50077a710ceb903e708dfe1279ead8dc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,12,235,245,0,119,167,16,206,185,3,231,8,223,225,39,158,173,141,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
