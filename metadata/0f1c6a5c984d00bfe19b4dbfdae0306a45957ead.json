Clark announces to his family that he is taking them on vacation. Enthusiasm wanes, however, when Clark says they are headed to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nHis wife, Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), and teenage daughter, Audrey (Marisol Nichols) have their doubts, as Las Vegas is not known for its family-friendly atmosphere, while Rusty (Ethan Embry) appears to be more eager, even asking if prostitution is legal there.\n\nUpon arriving in Vegas, the family embarks upon a series of mishaps and adventures. Clark crosses paths with Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid), the husband of Ellen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn). Eddie and his family now live in the desert just north of Las Vegas, on what used to be an H-bomb test site.\n\nWhile on a group tour of the gigantic Hoover Dam, Clark foolishly leaves the group after accidentally creating a leak in the dam's inside walkways, and is forced to climb the scaffolding to the very top of the dam to get out, because his cries for help cannot be heard over the roaring water of the spillway.\n\nDuring the vacation in Las Vegas, Clark becomes addicted to gambling, Rusty gets a fake ID and becomes a winning high roller, Audrey starts hanging out with Eddie's wild stripper daughter Vickie (Shae D'Lyn), and Ellen becomes addicted to Wayne Newton (playing himself), who may have feelings for Ellen, and it's making Clark jealous.\n\nAfter Clark gambles away the family's $22,600 bank account, EddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who has money buried in his front yardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½tries to come to the Griswold family's rescue in return for everything the Griswolds have done for him and his family over the years.\n\nUltimately, the family begins to fall apart, thanks to Clark's obsessive gambling, Ellen's infatuation with Wayne Newton, Rusty's new winning lifestyle, and Audrey's desire to hang out with Cousin Vicki rather than her family.\n\nThe Griswolds must learn how to come together as a family, or &quot;Sin City&quot; just might destroy their very fabric.\n\nNear the climax of the film, the Griswolds gamble their last two dollars on a game of Keno. They take a seat next to an older man (Sid Caesar in a cameo) who compliments Clark on his lovely family, and hints that he's been lonely all of his life. Out of guilt, Clark tells the man to consider himself part of the Griswold family for the night. The man happily accepts Clark's kind words, and both parties begin the game. At first, the Griswolds are hopeful, but as they realize they've already lost the game, they sadly sit for moments in silence. Suddenly, the man next to them ecstatically declares that he's won the game. As he continues to express joy, he suddenly begins to slip into a small series of comas when Ellen sends Rusty for help. He awakens one last time and whispers a message to Clark, before dropping his winning ticket and falling into the final coma. Clark, puzzled, tells Ellen that the man said &quot;take the ticket&quot;. When the casino security guards and paramedics arrive, they declare the man officially dead. They tell the Griswolds his name was Mr. Ellis, and commented on how sad his loneliness was to them. As Mr. Ellis is carried away, a janitor approaches with a vacuum cleaner; walking straight for the winning ticket on the floor. Though it appears Clark is going to allow it to be lost, he at last moment pulls the ticket out of the path of the vacuum.\n\nClark and Ellen remarry at the end. Afterwards, Clark hands Eddie a large pile of cash and explains by telling him that &quot;we were very fortunate last night&quot;. It was then that Rusty informed Clark of the four cars he had won. Clark then sternly demands the keys for all vehicles. Though it appears that Clark will refuse to allow the family to keep the vehicles, he quickly hands a set of keys to each member of the family. The movie rolls credits as the Griswolds are shown on the highway, driving back home to Chicago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f1c6a5c984d00bfe19b4dbfdae0306a45957ead","amp;dn":"Vegas+Vacation.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f1c6a5c984d00bfe19b4dbfdae0306a45957ead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,28,106,92,152,77,0,191,225,155,77,191,218,224,48,106,69,149,126,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
