Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nI scanned this months ago, then forgot about it until seeing it mentioned on reddit today. Well worth reading! The book deals with much more than the title might suggest.\n\ndescription:\n\nAn approach to the world and to life that stems from the liturgical experience of the Orthodox Church. Father Alexander deals with the issues of secularism and Christian culture, viewing them from the perspective of the Church as revealed and communicated in its worship and liturgy.\n\n&quot;A powerful, articulate (and) creative essay in sacramental theology. One of the best books I have read for a long time. I suggest every novice read it twice - at least once.&quot; - Thomas Merton. \n\n&quot;This is one of the best introductions to the sacraments, and not simply the 'Eastern' view of them. If you have not read it by all means do so now.&quot; - Leonel L. Mitchell, The Anglican. \n\nabout the author:\n\nAlexander Schmemann (1921 - 1983) was a prominent 20th century Orthodox Christian priest, teacher, and writer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:620b0b0fbb6ae78d9b534ffa56ae55c1a7aa191c","amp;dn":"Alexander+Schmemann+-+For+the+Life+of+the+World+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"620b0b0fbb6ae78d9b534ffa56ae55c1a7aa191c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,11,11,15,187,106,231,141,155,83,79,250,86,174,85,193,167,170,25,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
