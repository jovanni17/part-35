Who is involved and what weapons and tactics are they likely to use? The players on the counterterrorism team need to take stock of what is in their tool kits; what works and what doesn't work; and what new capabilities need to be developed in order to face not only today's terrorist, but tomorrow's as well.\n\nThe Counterterrorism Handbook: Tactics, Procedures, and Techniques lays out a comprehensive strategy of how to deal with an entire range of possible terrorist incidents in a language friendly to first responders, policymakers, and security personnel. It covers everything from bombings and hostage-taking, to nuclear terrorism and what needs to be done before, during, and after an event.\n\nThe authors each bring to the table unique insights and real-world experiences based on years in the counterterrorism field. Their hands-on knowledge of the topic infuse the book with a down-to-earth practicality often missing from other counterterrorism studies. The Counterterrorism Handbook: Tactics, Procedures, and Techniques is a must-read for anyone who may have to cope with a serious terrorist attack.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02c0e9d0f3be0c277608020392a4cf55e36e0e5a","amp;dn":"The+Counterterrorism+Handbook.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02c0e9d0f3be0c277608020392a4cf55e36e0e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,192,233,208,243,190,12,39,118,8,2,3,146,164,207,85,227,110,14,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
