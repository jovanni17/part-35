Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people people he cares about are counting on him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd7a89adafef98e21f642ee4d3b4b9d2ec327ef1","amp;dn":"Half+Life+2+%5BNO-Steam%5D%5BEnglish-Spanish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd7a89adafef98e21f642ee4d3b4b9d2ec327ef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,122,137,173,175,239,152,226,31,100,46,228,211,180,185,210,236,50,126,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
