You can put your hands on almost any preclear and you will find some semblance of it.  You can look into your own case, you can find that there is something in your own case that demonstrates you are continuing the goals, fears, identity of somebody else.  How come?  And particularly, how would you be able to undo this thing?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67146ac19ca6c6458acd15127acc48e5613d4b33","amp;dn":"The+Life+Continuum+%28Basics+Lecture%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67146ac19ca6c6458acd15127acc48e5613d4b33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,20,106,193,156,166,198,69,138,205,21,18,122,204,72,229,97,61,75,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
