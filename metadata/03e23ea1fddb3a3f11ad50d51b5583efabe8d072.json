Case in point, Busy P (aka Ed Banger label head Pedro Winter) recently released ÃƒÂ¢??Rainbow Man,ÃƒÂ¢?? a song framed around a sample of Comix/TGVÃƒÂ¢??s ÃƒÂ¢??Touche Pas Mon Sexe.ÃƒÂ¢??  It beefs up the original into a meaty dance floor groove and connects the dots from one digital era to another.\n\nWith lo-fi recordings and even lower promo budgets, bands like ACT, Comix/TGV and Vox Dei danced in a grey area between the tail end of the DIY Punk movement and the upswing of New Wave, pushing the guitars further out of the equation and placing the synthesizerÃƒÂ¢??s cold resonance at the forefront of their sound.  While they ran parallel with what was happening sonically in cities like Manchester and New York, most ran out of the economic steam that was necessary to achieve widespread public recognition and find a receptive audience outside of France.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e23ea1fddb3a3f11ad50d51b5583efabe8d072","amp;dn":"BIPPP%3A+French+Synth+Wave+1979-85+Video+%28iPod+Ready%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e23ea1fddb3a3f11ad50d51b5583efabe8d072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,226,62,161,253,219,58,63,17,173,80,213,27,85,131,239,171,232,208,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
