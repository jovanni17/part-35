Though I have a sizeable number, I don't scan novels because we generally read them once and stow them away. They have a very short shelf life, even less than the magazines! But since I had some time on my hands, I decided to scan a few smaller and scannable paperbacks of less than 250 pages.\nIn this torrent, I share with you some of them. They are over 20 years old but in good condition. Genres include sci-fi, horror and action/adventure. All have OCR, bookmarks &amp; covers. Hope the novel readers will enjoy them.\n\n01.
