This book is that story.\n\nIn A Singular Woman, award-winning New York Times reporter Janny Scott tells the story of this unique woman, Stanley Ann Dunham, who broke many of the rules of her time, and shows how her fierce example helped influence the future president-and can serve as an inspiration to us all.\n\n\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An ambitious new biography. . . . Scott pursues a more perplexing and elusive figure than the one Obama pieced together in his own books.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Even Obama knew that he had not his extraordinary mother justice. Janny Scott . . . does. She portrays Dunham as a feminist, an utterly independent spirit, a cultural anthropologies, and an international development officer who surely helped shape the internationalist, post-Vietnam-era world view of her son. ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is tirelessly researched, and the sections covering DunhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life in Indonesia especially are new and valuable to the accumulating biography of ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extended global family.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The New Yorker\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Janny Scott packs two and a half years of research into her bio of Stanley Ann Dunham, the quixotic anthropologist who raised a president.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€People\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“The restrained, straight-ahead focusÃ¢â‚¬â€rather in the spirit, it turns out, of Dunham herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€pays off. By recovering ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother from obscurity, A Singular Woman adds in a meaningful way to an understanding of a singular president.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Slate\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The key to understanding the disciplined and often impassive 44th president is his mother, as Janny Scott, a reporter for the New York Times, decisively demonstrates in her new biography A Singular Woman. . . . Scott [uses] meticulous reporting, archival research and extensive interviews with DunhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s colleagues, friends and family, including the president and his sister. What emerges is a portrait of a woman who is both disciplined and disorganized, blunt-spoken and empathetic, driven and devoted to her children, even as she ruefully admits her failings and frets over her distance from them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Meticulously-researched and well-written . . . a necessary counterpart and corrective to ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first book Dreams from my Father.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Financial Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In her own right, Ann Dunham was a fascinating woman. . . . The story of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsingular womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ at the center of this book is told, and told well, by Scott.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€San Francisco Chronicle\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“What emerges in this straightforward, deeply reported account is a complicated portrait of an outspoken, independent-minded woman with a life of unconventional choices.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€USA Today\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We get a much fuller story of Ms. DunhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life in A Singular Woman, Janny ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s richly researched, unsentimental book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The New York Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you want to understand what shaped our president, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look to his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearance. It was his unconventional mother who made him. . . . [An] incisive biography.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Newsweek\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A richly nuanced, decidedly sympathetic portrait of President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkably accomplished, spirited mother. . . . A biography of considerable depth and understanding.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Kirkus\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Scott gives us a vivid, affecting profile of an unsung feminist pioneer who made breaking down barriers a family tradition and whose legacy extends well beyond her presidential son.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly (starred)\n \nAbout the Author\nJanny Scott was a reporter for The New York Times from 1994 to 2009, when she left to write this book.
