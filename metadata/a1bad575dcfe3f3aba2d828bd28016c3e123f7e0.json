Catches and Glees is their debut album as a duo but has a confidence and assuredness that belie their young years. The sound is dominated by Sam SweeneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiddle and the sweet and distinctive voice of Hannah James but peppered here and there with nyckelharpa, pipes and clogs.\n\nThere are lively, foot-tapping instrumental tunes such as Ã¢â‚¬â„¢DickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Maggot/Dog Leap StairsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Catches &amp; GleesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ itself, together with the more mournful Ã¢â‚¬â„¢You are the OneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ &amp; Ã¢â‚¬â„¢PolskaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nThe vocal tracks are new arrangements of traditional material and cover the typical subject matter of folk songs. Death (Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Died for LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), lost loves gone to sea (The Young and Single Sailor), and the pleasures of rotting in jail (an excellent version of the traditional Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Gaol SongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) are all covered here, and done very well.\n\nHighlights include the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impassioned opener Gaol Song with itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tale of a young man hauled before the magistrate and sentenced to hard labour and in a complete change of pace a superb ghostly version of the ancient ballad of the Three Ravens.\n\nThis is a album of traditional material performed by two of the brightest young stars of the folk scene and throughly enjoyable to boot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1bad575dcfe3f3aba2d828bd28016c3e123f7e0","amp;dn":"Hannah+James+%26amp%3B+Sam+Sweeney+-+Catches+%26amp%3B+Glees+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1bad575dcfe3f3aba2d828bd28016c3e123f7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,186,213,117,220,254,63,58,186,45,130,139,210,128,22,195,225,35,247,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
