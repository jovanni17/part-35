I think that is some how fake (its only 264.75 KiB in size) and that he is just trying to prove everybody that it does not work.\n\nHe (like many others) is making money of other people by selling them garmin unlocking codes. \nNow that JetMouse has shared this keygen he is goint out of his mind. Saying that it does not work. Just see comments on this torrent, page 2: \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3915007/Garmin_City_Navigator_Europe_NT_2008-ShareAll&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3915007/Garmin_City_Navigator_Europe_NT_2008-ShareAll&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWhy, you ask? Because he can no longer make easy money :(\n\n\n\nI have made it to work on my Garmin Nuvi 300 with this keygen. This is what I did: \n\n\n1. I downloaded the Garmin City Navigator Europe, by Shareall (see above)\n \n2. I downloaded this keygen \n\n3. Then I did as it said in instructions by user &quot;jameskrueger3rd&quot; in above mentionded torrent: \n\n      1. In Nuvi go to -&gt; Settings -&gt; System -&gt; About -&gt; Unit ID \n      2. Enter the ID in Kg (first input) to get Device Code.\n      3. Select &quot;custom mapset&quot; in Kg and enter 284 to get unlock code\n      4. Now just follow strictly &quot;Solution.txt&quot;\n\n\n\nYou will find &quot;Solution.txt&quot; in the torren mentioned avbove. \n\n\n\nAnd thats it! I made it work, so can you.\n\n\n\nIf you need help, just post the message here and I will come back to you. \n\n \nI will seed as much as possible. Starting from 07.dec. 13:00.PM\nI have 10mb line. \n\n\n\nPS: You will need 1.3 GB free space for this (either on SD card or on a Garmin unit). City Navigator v.9 is huuuge. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cce60ac21d856d11214ec940715334378d1bfe8","amp;dn":"Garmin+Keygen%2C+made+by+JetMouse+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cce60ac21d856d11214ec940715334378d1bfe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,206,96,172,33,216,86,209,18,20,236,148,7,21,51,67,120,209,191,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
