To download\n\nThis you will need a torrent program like Bit torrent or U Torrent. Bit Lord works too.\n\nTutorial(If you want it with a shortcut on your desktop and it to be in your files):\n\n- Once the torrent is finished downloading, open it. You will see a readme with instructions inside.\n\nRead these or the others, same result.\n\n- Download PowerIso ( http://poweriso.com/ )\n\n- Restart your PC if you did not have PowerIso before.\n\n- Go in the folder called &quot;Skyrim&quot;\n\n- Extract it on your desktop or anywhere but somewhere out of the archive.\n\n- Right click on it and choose poweriso.\n\n- Choose Mount C:/Users/ bla bla bla\n\n- Go to your disc area and you will see it mounted.\n\n- Open it.\n\n- Go to where ever you want your game to be,i chose c:Games\n\n- Go to your desktop\n\n- Make a new folder called Skyrim\n\n- Drag all the files from your iso disc mounted on your PC inside the folder called\n\nskyrim you just created.\n\n- Once its done just drag the skyrim folder where you want your game in your files \n\nto be EX: c:Games\n\n- Then if you did the file to C:Games, do this. If you didn't, do it with a \n\nDifferent location. Go to your desktop and Right click. Do New-&gt; Shortcut and then\n\nDo C:GamesSkyrimSkyrimLauncher.exe. Once again if you did not put the Skyrim\n\nFolder in Games then is your own business.\n\nThen right click on the shortcut and install the game ( It installs for 2 seconds )\n\nIf you did not understand check my video tutorial.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nTUTORIAL (If you are too lazy to do all that)\n\n- Open the torrent\n\n- Extract the ISO file on your desktop or somewhere just so at be out of the Archive.\n\n- Download PowerIso ( http://poweriso.com/ )\n\n- Restart your PC if you did not have PowerIso before.\n\n- Choose Mount C:/Users/ bla bla bla\n\n- Go to your disc area and you will see it mounted.\n\n- Open it.\n\n- Go to SkyrimLauncher and launch and install the game.
