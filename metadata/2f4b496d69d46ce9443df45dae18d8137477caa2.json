Based on over 200 hours of footage, the film provides a candid retelling of the events following the fall of Baghdad in 2003 by high ranking officials such as former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, Ambassador Barbara Bodine (in charge of Baghdad during the Spring of 2003), Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell, and General Jay Garner (in charge of the occupation of Iraq through May 2003) as well as Iraqi civilians, American soldiers, and prominent analysts. NO END IN SIGHT examines the manner in which the principal errors of U.S. policy ? the use of insufficient troop levels, allowing the looting of Baghdad, the purging of professionals from the Iraqi government, and the disbanding of the Iraqi military ? largely created the insurgency and chaos that engulf Iraq today. How did a group of men with little or no military experience, knowledge of the Arab world or personal experience in Iraq come to make such flagrantly debilitating decisions? NO END IN SIGHT dissects the people, issues and facts behind the Bush Administration?s decisions and their consequences on the ground to provide a powerful look into how arrogance and ignorance turned a military victory into a seemingly endless and deepening nightmare of a war. ÃƒÂ¡\n\n\nNO END SIGHT alternates between U.S. policy decisions and Iraqi consequences, systematically dissecting the Bush Administration?s decisions. ÃƒÂ¡The consequences of those decisions now include 3,000 American deaths and 20,000 American wounded, Iraq on the brink of civil war, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian deaths, the strengthening of Iran, the weakening of the U.S. military, and economic costs of over $2 trillion. It marks the first time Americans will be allowed inside the White House, Pentagon, and Baghdad?s Green Zone to understand for themselves what has become the disintegration of Iraq.\n\n\n\nFor more information or to purchase this movie, please visit:\n\nwww noendinsightmovie com\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO, the Illuminati and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f4b496d69d46ce9443df45dae18d8137477caa2","amp;dn":"No+End+In+Sight+%282007%29+%5BDVD+-+NTSC+-+Iraq-+NWO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f4b496d69d46ce9443df45dae18d8137477caa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,75,73,109,105,212,108,233,68,61,244,93,174,24,216,19,116,119,202,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
