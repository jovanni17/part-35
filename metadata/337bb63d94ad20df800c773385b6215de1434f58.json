Surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Russian tanks and planes, he and his men are doomed until famed German tank ace, Michael Wittmann, shows up in his Tiger Tank and saves the day. Once wounded, Klaus is transferred to Normandy to serve under Field Marshal Rommel just days before the Allied invasion. Much to his surprise, he finds that his beloved Klaudia is also stationed nearby as a field nurse. Unfortunately, so is her father, who is working with the French resistance and now finds himself pursued by the ruthless Gestapo officer Brahms, whose search leads him to Klaus and Klaudia attempting a rescue. They are caught and imprisoned. As D-Day begins and the Allies attack from the beaches and the sky, they escape from the prison, fighting the Gestapo in the middle of the biggest invasion in world historyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nGenre: War \nIMDB Rating: 4.1/10 \nDirected by: Tino Struckmann \nStarring: Tino Struckmann, Damian Chapa and Jack Dimich \n\nRelease Name: Red.Rose.of.Normandy.2011.DVDRiP.XVID-HS \nSize: 704 MiB \nVideo: XVID, 640Ãƒâ€”352, 828 Kbps, 23.976 fps \nAudio: English, MP3, 128 Kbps \nRuntime: 1h 42mn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:337bb63d94ad20df800c773385b6215de1434f58","amp;dn":"Red+Rose+of+Normandy.2011.DVDRiP.HS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"337bb63d94ad20df800c773385b6215de1434f58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,123,182,61,148,173,32,223,128,12,119,51,133,182,33,93,225,67,79,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
