Fossils collected from all over the world are one of our most important sources of information about the organisms that have existed on Earth since the very earliest times, even hundreds of millions of years ago. \n\nResearch into fossils enables us to learn about extinct plants and animals, as well as earlier forms of species still in existence today. Thanks to this information, we learn which life forms existed at what epochs in time, what these life forms' features were, and whether they resembled present-day species.\n\nIndeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the [great] ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people, and what Allah has sent down from the heavens of rain, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every [kind of] moving creature, and [His] directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth are signs for a people who use reason.(Quran 2:164)\n\nGenre: Non Fiction, Religion | Islamic Creationism, Geology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d777308d9174795a42c4673277715de3d8109b1","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+Creation+Volume+1+to+4+by+Harun+Yahya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d777308d9174795a42c4673277715de3d8109b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,119,115,8,217,23,71,149,164,44,70,115,39,119,21,222,61,129,9,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
