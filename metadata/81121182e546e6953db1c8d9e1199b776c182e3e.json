Next generation micro channels offer record high heat transfer coefficients with pressure drops much less than conventional micro channel heat exchangers. These inherent features promise fast penetration into many mew markets, including high heat flux cooling of electronics, waste heat recovery and energy efficiency enhancement applications, alternative energy systems, as well as applications in mass exchangers and chemical reactor systems. The combination of up to the minute research findings and technical know-how make this book very timely as the search for high performance heat and mass exchangers that can cut costs in materials consumption intensifies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81121182e546e6953db1c8d9e1199b776c182e3e","amp;dn":"Next+Generation+Microchannel+Heat+Exchangers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81121182e546e6953db1c8d9e1199b776c182e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,18,17,130,229,70,230,149,61,177,200,217,225,25,155,119,108,24,46,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
