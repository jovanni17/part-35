As the album's coordinator, musician Marty \nStuart has the background and contacts to pull this project off. Any collection \nwith previously unreleased tracks from Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Dwight \nYoakam, Emmylou Harris, and Steve Earle has built in credibility. All the \nparticipants are enthusiastic and dedicated, but the most stirring tracks inject \na different spin to the originals. Unfortunately there aren't enough of those. \nStuart's version of &quot;Hey Porter&quot; is respectful but doesn't deviate enough from \nCash's boom-chika rockabilly to make it worth the effort. Yoakam's \n&quot;Understand Your Man&quot; even keeps the mariachi trumpets that added such an \noffbeat sound to Cash's '60s work. Daughter Rosanne's version of &quot;I Still Miss \nSomeone&quot; is tender but lacks punch, as does Springsteen's solo acoustic &quot;Give \nMy Love to Rose,&quot; which sounds like an outtake from Nebraska. Dylan's \nspoken intro to &quot;Train of Love&quot; thanks Cash for standing up for him &quot;way back \nwhen&quot; before launching into one of the most emotionally stirring \nperformances on this album. Little Richard does his best &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; with \na rock'em sock'em &quot;Get Rhythm,&quot; but his voice isn't what it used to be and the \nsong ends up sounding more like a Richard tune than a Cash one. Much \nbetter is Keb' Mo', who slows down &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; to an ominous, \nswamp/bluesy crawl. Travis Tritt successfully rearranges &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; \ninto a slow but menacing honky tonk ballad similar to how George Jones might \napproach it. Though it's fraught with the best intentions and tries to deviate \nfrom the hits (where's &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;?), Kindred Spirits is disappointing \nbecause even with the high-profile talent, few add anything unique, \nenlightening, or inspirational to Cash's already timeless music. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad2630c780eee1bff997e8c1f210efe0f9f2895","amp;dn":"VA-Kindred+Spirits%3A+A+Tribute+to+Johnny+Cash+%5B2002%2F192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad2630c780eee1bff997e8c1f210efe0f9f2895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,210,99,12,120,14,238,27,255,153,126,140,31,33,14,254,15,159,40,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
