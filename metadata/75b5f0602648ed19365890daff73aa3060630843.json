They simple want to rock and that's all. But that's something very important. No matter if some of the songs on Acid Eaters are classic radio classics (in the other hand there are some pretty obscure numbers) cos' all of them really rock.\n\nJourney to the Center of the Mind by the Amboy Dukes (with a very young Ted Nugent on the line-up), Substitute with Pete Townshend as guest singing back ups is simply amazing, as well as Marky drumming. My Back Pages is taken from the version that the Byrds did in their Younger Than Yesterday album instead of the 3/4 tempo of the original Another Side of Bob Dylan version. When I Was Young is another &quot;hidden treasure&quot; cos it's a single of the second-era Animals when they were called Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals circa 1967.\n\nNot a single bad song on the album. Essential purchase. Do yourself a favour and go quickly to find the originals. Satisfaction guaranteed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75b5f0602648ed19365890daff73aa3060630843","amp;dn":"Ramones+-+Acid+Eaters+-+Cover+Remakes+Punk+Style+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75b5f0602648ed19365890daff73aa3060630843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,181,240,96,38,72,237,25,54,88,144,218,255,115,170,48,96,99,8,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
