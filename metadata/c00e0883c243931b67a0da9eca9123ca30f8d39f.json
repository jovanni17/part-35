He accidentally witnesses a married couple having sex through a hole on the floor of his second story room. He discovers he is a voyeur at heart and becomes bolder and bolder in his actions. One day, he gets an opportunity to play out his fantasies. When the husband is not home, Sang-ho goes downstairs. Imitating the husband's manner of foreplay even down to the sequence, the young man has sex with the wife. She, like Sang-ho, is a prisoner of the house. The second time he comes to her, he touches her in a different way which makes her turn around and discover that there is a stranger in her bed. But this does not deter her as she reaches out to him for an intense embrace. The husband, Tae-yeol, is an ex-policeman fired for alleged corruption, and his wife Hee-ran, who was raped by him as a young girl, for the sake of status quo has ended up as his wife and prisoner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c00e0883c243931b67a0da9eca9123ca30f8d39f","amp;dn":"Summer+Time%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c00e0883c243931b67a0da9eca9123ca30f8d39f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,14,8,131,194,67,147,27,103,160,218,158,202,145,35,202,48,248,211,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
