If you ever make money from your music, be sure to support companies like Audio Damage by buying their products. OK, sermon over...\n\nAlmost any loop can be given added oomph by running it through an external processor. Some effects (e.g reverb) work best when applied subtly. For attention-grabbing sounds, however, you need something more extreme. Audio Damage specializes in unique effects that create big, phat sounds that push tracks to the front of the mix. This pack contains several Audio Damage plug-ins which have received excellent reviews in the press. If you want to make tracks with warmth, phatness or downright carnage, you need this pack.\n\n8 plug-ins in 5 RAR files\n-------------------------\nDiscord 2 - Pitch-shifting voice doubler with delay.\nLiquid - Sweet-sounding thru-the-null flange unit.\nReplicant - On-the-fly loop slicing and re-arranging.\nRonin - Filter Delay with several modulation options.\nMayhem Pack, featuring:\nCrush - A simple compressor.\nMaster Destrukto - Compression/Overdrive/Distortion with bit-crushing.\nFilterpod - Sweepable filter with envelope follower. (Fantastic for distorted 303 lines!)\nTimeFnk - Chorus/Delay/Filter.\n\nThanks to AIR, Paradox and DAC for the cracks/keygens.\n\nAll plugs tested and working on Win XP running FL Studio, Acid Pro, and Wavelab. Should also be fine with Cubase and most other sequencers.\nFull instructions are included.\n\n--\nArty &quot;Totally crushed&quot;\n10th February 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269cd3ffa031bf67deb65a80dc2a590ea8a32f97","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+47-Audio+Damage+VST+FX+plug-ins-Liquid%2C+Replica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269cd3ffa031bf67deb65a80dc2a590ea8a32f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,156,211,255,160,49,191,103,222,182,90,128,220,42,89,14,168,163,47,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
