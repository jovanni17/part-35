Drinkwater (who claims to be a clone of the &quot;original&quot; Sean T. Drinkwater). They formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1999. The band is named after the frozen snack. The members describe their music as &quot;sweet and cold and fruity and plastic-y&quot;, much like the snack.[1]\n\nThey have gained a number of fans through their work in video games, and several of their songs can be found on titles such as FreQuency, Amplitude, Karaoke Revolution, Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, Phase, Rock Band, Guitar Hero: On Tour, Flash Flash Revolution, and Downhill Domination, along with one of the North American entries in the Dance Dance Revolution series. Many of these games were developed by Harmonix, a company for which Kasson Crooker is a Senior Producer.\n\nTRACK LISTINGS:\n\n   1. &quot;Stakeout&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n   2. &quot;Bike Thief&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n   3. &quot;I Am Not Your Gameboy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n   4. &quot;Parlez-vous Freezepop?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n   5. &quot;Chess King&quot; (K.
