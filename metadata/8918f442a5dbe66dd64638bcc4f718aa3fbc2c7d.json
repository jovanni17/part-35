Questions is about 10 minutes.\n\n\nA word about quality - Some people frown on this but I used MPEG 1 (VCD) quality. I feel they are very watchable and I know that there are better compressors out there but I like the simple route. Sorry about the slow upload, that's my lot in life. Will try and put out other seasons (I have them all) when there are one or two seeders of this season. Be Mad (but in a good way). - MC\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8918f442a5dbe66dd64638bcc4f718aa3fbc2c7d","amp;dn":"Good+Eats+Specials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8918f442a5dbe66dd64638bcc4f718aa3fbc2c7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,24,244,66,165,219,230,109,214,70,56,188,196,247,24,170,63,188,44,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
