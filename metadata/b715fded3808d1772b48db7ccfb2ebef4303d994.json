At first only the arrow-firing variant was used, and it was not until the reign of Alexander the Great that stone-projecting catapults were introduced. The Romans adopted these weapons during the Punic Wars and further developed them, before introducing the new arrow-firing ballista and stone-throwing onager. This title traces the often controversial design, development and construction of these weapons throughout the history of the classical world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b715fded3808d1772b48db7ccfb2ebef4303d994","amp;dn":"Greek+and+Roman+Artillery+399+BC-AD+363","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b715fded3808d1772b48db7ccfb2ebef4303d994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,21,253,237,56,8,209,119,43,72,219,124,207,178,235,239,67,3,217,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
