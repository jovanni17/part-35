A team of scientists decides to try and rescue it...\r\nThis is how the Call of the Baby Beluga begins, a story that will take you to the belugas in the heart of the St. Lawrence Estuary. The group spent months in the company of research teams tracking belugas in their habitat. The end result of these hundreds of hours of filming is captivating, and relates the story of this small and threatened population of white whales and the efforts that researchers have been making for decades to protect them.\r\nThe story becomes grim as European whalers then settlers killed thousands of belugas for leather and oil. Then, in the 1920s, the government put a bounty on belugas because fishermen mistakenly believed the whales were destroying fisheries. Commercial hunting continued until 1959, and sport hunting lasted another two decades. Then, out of the decimation of the killing, the whales were suddenly embraced by humans when we learned of their intelligence and social lives.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1b/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/93/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Call-of-the-Baby-Beluga-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3161 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 996 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/call-of-the-baby-beluga","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dfdee0b9358dd93460987a1183e39afe4af50a5","amp;dn":"The+Nature+Of+Things+Call+of+the+Baby+Beluga+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dfdee0b9358dd93460987a1183e39afe4af50a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,253,238,11,147,88,221,147,70,9,135,161,24,62,57,175,228,175,80,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
