There&amp;#039;s no index in Windows though so you&amp;#039;ll be flying blind!\n\nI was able to burn these images onto CD using an NEC burner but couldn&amp;#039;t read it in Windows using the same drive, but a Lite-On drive would read it... My A500+ with A570 drive can read it though.\n\nIf this is popular then I&amp;#039;ll post the next 3 CDs in the series which feature increasingly more AGA stuff, so remember to leave comments if you want more :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55471ad7de0748c3ed9b65c0eebfed0c57c410b5","amp;dn":"Amiga+PD+CDs+-+17+Bit+Collection+A%26B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55471ad7de0748c3ed9b65c0eebfed0c57c410b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,71,26,215,222,7,72,195,237,155,101,192,238,191,237,12,87,196,16,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
