Tracing in reverse the journeys\nthat refugees have taken to reach Australia, they travel to\nsome of the most dangerous and desperate corners of the\nworld, with no idea what is in store for them along the way.\n\n\nDeprived of their wallets, phones and passports, they board a\nleaky refugee boat, are rescued mid-ocean, experience\nimmigration raids in Malaysia, live in a Kenyan refugee camp\nand visit slums in Jordan before ultimately making it to the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and Iraq, protected by UN\nPeacekeepers and the US military. For some of them its their\nfirst time abroad. For all of them, its an epic journey and the\nmost challenging experience of their lives.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sbs.com.au/shows/goback/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sbs.com.au/shows/goback/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe final part of SBS's eye-opening refugee experience.\n\n\nThere will also be a one hour follow up talk/forum airing\n2011/06/28.\n\n\n \n\n\n _ W4F is looking for _\n\n 100mbit+ affil sites with archives\n\n Broadcast/Network/PPV Cappers with PDTV/HDTV Sources (US/UK/AU)\n\n People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping\n\n TV/WWE/MMA DVD Rippers/Suppliers\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Contact us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5522613336273022153238343c397b363a38&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Releasing TV since 2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab06890bd9596dfbe7c9c442b02b18118a0a812","amp;dn":"Go.Back.To.Where.You.Came.From.Part3.HDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab06890bd9596dfbe7c9c442b02b18118a0a812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,176,104,144,189,149,150,223,190,124,156,68,43,2,177,129,24,160,168,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
