The band experimented with a variety of sounds and genres, particularly grunge, funk and psychedelic rock. The band consisted of Scott Hunter with the vocals, Jesse Sprinkle as the drummer for the band, Aaron Sprinkle as guitarist, and Nick Barber on bass. Scott was the lyricist who wrote on philosophical, metaphorical, and spiritually-oriented topics. Common themes in the lyrics include introspective struggles with identity and spirituality, struggles with a superficial, secular, and modern society, and hope for life abundant. The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music calls the band &quot;One of the most accomplished and creative Christian bands of the '90s&quot;\n\nBe Blessed,\nTorrentTracts - November 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a70c38a40b05712de817b949b76f399b59c152a5","amp;dn":"Poor+Old+Lu+Discography+1993-2013+%289+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a70c38a40b05712de817b949b76f399b59c152a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,12,56,164,11,5,113,45,232,23,185,73,183,111,57,155,89,193,82,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
