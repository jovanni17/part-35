When published in 2008 it was banned for Ã¢â‚¬Å“offending public moralsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and remains banned despite the change in government. The offending public morals is one of those classic phrases of despotic regimes and rarely do the artists condemned with those words actually offend anything but the regimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sense of invincibility. Given the profound changes that have swept over Egypt in the last year and a half, Metro, which was written and banned several years before those events, has taken on not only the voice of protest it has always had, but also a document of the problems that led to the Arab Spring.\n\n---\n\nProduct description from Amazon: \n\nWhen Shehab, a young software designer, runs afoul of a loan shark, all avenues of escape in MubarakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s corrupt, chaotic Egypt seem to be closed to him. Getting help from the bank is impossible without connections, and Shehab's uncle abroad wants nothing to do with his troubles. A powerful businessman offers assistance, but the next day Shehab sees him being stabbed in an alleyÃ¢â‚¬â€and the man's dying words suggest a conspiracy extending to the upper reaches of the regime.\n \nAngry and broke, Shehab enlists his friend Mustafa in a bank heistÃ¢â‚¬â€and falls into a vortex of financial and political corruption. On the run with a case full of money and evidence of murder, the two careen through Cairo's metro system, evading the police and the thugs who are out in force to crush antigovernment protests. The only allies who can help get them out of this mess, the friends realize, are a blind shoe-shine man and a muckraking journalist.\n \nIn art as pulsing and immediate as Cairo itself, Magdy El Shafee has delivered a prescient portrait of a crumbling society and Egypt's coming eruption. A powerful story of young men with nothing left to lose, Metro sounds the cry for a better, freer future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34eedeafc3bf5c40d393d5c4d78c6215e446a87c","amp;dn":"Metro+-+A+Story+of+Cairo+by+Magdy+El+Shafee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34eedeafc3bf5c40d393d5c4d78c6215e446a87c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,238,222,175,195,191,92,64,211,147,213,196,215,140,98,21,228,70,168,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
