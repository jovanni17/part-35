Yet, even in his most aesthetic analyses, Schapiro never lost sight of the heroic efforts of the individual artists and of the cultural contexts in which their works were made and received.\n\nModern Art won the National Book Critics Circle Award (1978) and the Mitchell Prize for Art History (1979) and was a nominee for a National Book Award (1979).
