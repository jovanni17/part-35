Some books were updated in this version. So it is a more current. If you have those, you can deleted them safely. No need to seed volumes 1, 2, 3, 1-5.\nAll you need is this torrent.\n******************************************\n\nThis is the reference collection of books on the NWO related issues. It contains some of the most reputable research by some of the most respected and widely quoted authors.\n\nAny book in this collection is &quot;must read&quot; type of book.\n\nNote: some books may not be in the main index. So, check all the folders and read it from there.\n\nYou can change the way it looks by providing your own style sheets (css/main.css and css/gbook/css).\n\nSeveral large collections of quotes is provided.\n\nThe entire collection is searchable via search engine at http://antimatrix.org/Convert/search.php\n\nSome of these books are out of print and some are not likely to be printed because the information is a bomb, and, since all the media is under total control, no publisher will dare to publish it. Some of these books will be hard to impossible to find in the HTML version.\n\nThe versions provided in this collection contain the detailed table of contents identifying all the issues covered in the book. This makes it much easier to find the issues you are interested in, and for the researchers it will drastically reduce the amount of time they need to spend to find some information on the issues they are researching.\n\nThis collection contains both, English and Russian language versions. Some of the best books are only available in Russian while others are only in English. Even if you do not know the language, you still might want to read these books via some translation service such as translate.google.com. Even though translation is not perfect, but still, information is so valuable that you will be able to see the most essential part of it. In particular, the works of Gregory Klimov in Russian, that were never published in English because to total censorship, are worth a read via translation service.\n\nSome books are also available in audio format. Check Books/Audio subdirectory.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5714c06b874106d396fb8ec4e1e9a83b8ef1122f","amp;dn":"NWO%2C+ZioNazi%2C+Illuminati%2C+Freemason%2C+Secret+Societies+Vol.1-56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5714c06b874106d396fb8ec4e1e9a83b8ef1122f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,20,192,107,135,65,6,211,150,251,142,196,225,233,168,59,142,241,18,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
