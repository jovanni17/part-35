G. Wodehouse. It was first published in the UK on October 9, 1925 by Herbert Jenkins, London, and in the U.S. on October 7, 1927 by George H. Doran, New York. Many of the stories had previously appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, and some were rewritten versions of stories in the collection My Man Jeeves (1919). The book is considered part of the Jeeves canon.\n\nStories:\n\n    * &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot;\n    * &quot;The Artistic Career of Corky&quot;\n    * &quot;Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest&quot;\n    * &quot;Jeeves and the Hard-boiled Egg&quot;\n    * &quot;The Aunt and the Sluggard&quot;\n    * &quot;The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy&quot;\n    * &quot;Without the Option&quot;\n    * &quot;Fixing It for Freddie&quot;\n    * &quot;Clustering Round Young Bingo&quot;\n    * &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot;\n\nsmall cover:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b48e5d3a46b482b0cb67802e1276a25830ab1e5c","amp;dn":"P.G.+Wodehouse+-+Carry+On%2C+Jeeves+%28Jonathan+Cecil%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b48e5d3a46b482b0cb67802e1276a25830ab1e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,142,93,58,70,180,130,176,203,103,128,46,18,118,162,88,48,171,30,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
