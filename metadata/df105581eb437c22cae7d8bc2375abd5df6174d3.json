This image ran in newspapers and magazines across the world, and should have been the defining image of that terrible day. Instead, it was suddenly and inexplicably taken out of circulation. Why?\n\nMany people were seen, and captured on (this) film, falling from the WTC 1 &amp; 2.\n\nThe only visible fatalities, on a day that claimed thousands.\n\nThe Falling Man follows the trail of the photograph - of the photographer who shot it, of the citizens who decried it, of the editors who published and then banned it, of the journalist who tried to identify the figure.\n It is an extraordinary trial.\n\nNetanyahu was already thinking strategically. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how The New York Times reported it:\n\n  Asked tonight what the attack meant for relations between the United States and Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, the former (and now current) prime minister, replied, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very good.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Then he edited himself: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well, not very good, but it will generate immediate sympathy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He predicted that the attack would Ã¢â‚¬Å“strengthen the bond between our two peoples, because weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve experienced terror over so many decades, but the United States has now experienced a massive hemorrhaging of terror.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEven after generously allowing Netanyahu to Ã¢â‚¬Å“editÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ himself, the Times did not conceal that Netanyahu was not thinking in terms of sympathy for the victims of 9/11 and the United States, nor what a Ã¢â‚¬Å“friendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ could do to help America. Rather, he was already thinking on the day it happened about how 9/11 could be manipulated to get America to do more for Israel.\n\nAmerica Rebuilds (DVD) All about WTCs 1, 2, 5, 6 &amp; 7 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7427913/America_Rebuilds_%282002%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7427913/America_Rebuilds_%282002%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDonald Rumsfeld = Top Gun = &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7422562/Donald_Rumsfeld___Top_Gun___Biography_%282002%29_.avi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7422562/Donald_Rumsfeld___Top_Gun___Biography_%282002%29_.avi&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/igpenoiwl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/igpenoiwl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ba1bgw7p3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ba1bgw7p3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/od74zbsnv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/od74zbsnv&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df105581eb437c22cae7d8bc2375abd5df6174d3","amp;dn":"9%2F11+THE+FALLiNG+MAN+%28DVD5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df105581eb437c22cae7d8bc2375abd5df6174d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,16,85,129,235,67,124,34,202,231,216,188,35,117,171,213,223,97,116,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
