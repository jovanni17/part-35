Rollo Martins, a second-rate novelist, arrives penniless to visit his friend and hero, Harry Lime. But Harry has died in suspicious circumstances, and the police are closing in on his associatesÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦\n\nGraham Greene wrote the book and then the screenplay for the British film directed by Carol Reed and starring Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles as Harry Lime. With sound effects, the film theme tune and Martin Jarvis&amp;#039;s effective tone, this unabridged title attempts to create the atmosphere of the film as well as do justice to this atmospheric novella. \n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:182cfa2a4f0afabeb6048aa9dc924e8b59c173ad","amp;dn":"Graham+Greene+-+The+Third+Man+-+read+by+martin+jarvis+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"182cfa2a4f0afabeb6048aa9dc924e8b59c173ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,44,250,42,79,10,250,190,182,4,138,169,220,146,78,139,89,193,115,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
