Although I could find no English subtitles, the good picture quality and superior acting make the story quite easy to follow. The emphasis on the scandalous behaviour of the tabloids parallels what was happening in the actress' own life, and she killed herself soon after.\n\nThis transitional movie combines sound and silent techniques, somewhat like The Jazz Singer. The music is in terrible condition, the spoken dialogue is much better; perhaps it was re-dubbed in recent years. Chinese intertitles are provided for the benefit of those who don't speak Mandarin. Anyone out there got English subtitles?\n\nAnother youtube reseed in flv format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a5fd80c8f6c468ec42ed01af47e418d40cf448","amp;dn":"%E6%96%B0%E5%A5%B3%E6%80%A7+New+Women+%281935%29+Ruan+Lingyu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a5fd80c8f6c468ec42ed01af47e418d40cf448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,165,253,128,200,246,196,104,236,66,237,1,175,71,228,24,212,12,244,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
