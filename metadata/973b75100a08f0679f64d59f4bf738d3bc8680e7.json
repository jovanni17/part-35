A. Milne originally published in Punch. Stories included are; The Heir, Winter Sport, A Baker's Dozen, Getting Married, Home Affairs, Other People's Houses, Burlesques, Merely Players and The Men Who Succeed. The collection was first published on 15 October 1914 (source: Wikipedia).\n\nExcerpt\nEVERYBODY knows, in a general way, that the finest place in the world isÃ¢â‚¬â€or, alas, wasÃ¢â‚¬â€the Dutch borough of Vondervotteimittiss. Yet as it lies some distance from any of the main roads, being in a somewhat outÃ¢â‚¬â€œofÃ¢â‚¬â€œtheÃ¢â‚¬â€œway situation, there are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit. For the benefit of those who have not, therefore, it will be only proper that I should enter into some account of it. And this is indeed the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting public sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred within its limits. No one who knows me will doubt that the duty thus selfÃ¢â‚¬â€œimposed will be executed to the best of my ability, with all that rigid impartiality, all that cautious examination into facts, and diligent collation of authorities, which should ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian. By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am enabled to say, positively, that the borough of Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely the same condition which it at present preserves. Of the date of this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are, at times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae. The date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its antiquity, cannot be less than any assignable quantity whatsoever. Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault. Among a multitude of opinions upon this delicate pointÃ¢â‚¬â€some acute, some learned, some sufficiently the reverseÃ¢â‚¬â€I am able to select nothing which ought to be considered satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of GrogswiggÃ¢â‚¬â€nearly coincident with that of KroutaplentteyÃ¢â‚¬â€is to be cautiously preferred.Ã¢â‚¬â€It runs:Ã¢â‚¬â€&quot;VondervotteimittisÃ¢â‚¬â€Vonder, lege DonderÃ¢â‚¬â€Votteimittis, quasi und BleitzizÃ¢â‚¬â€Bleitziz obsol:Ã¢â‚¬â€pro Blitzen.&quot; This derivative, to say the truth, is still countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the summit of the steeple of the House of the TownÃ¢â‚¬â€œCouncil. I do not choose, however, to commit myself on a theme of such importance, and must refer the reader desirous of information to the &quot;Oratiunculae de Rebus PraeterÃ¢â‚¬â€œVeteris,&quot; of Dundergutz. See, also, Blunderbuzzard &quot;De Derivationibus,&quot; pp. 27 to 5010, Folio, Gothic edit., Red and Black character, CatchÃ¢â‚¬â€œword and No Cypher; wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of Stuffundpuff, with the SubÃ¢â‚¬â€œCommentaries of Gruntundguzzell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:973b75100a08f0679f64d59f4bf738d3bc8680e7","amp;dn":"Once+a+Week+by+A.+A.+Milne+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"973b75100a08f0679f64d59f4bf738d3bc8680e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,59,117,16,10,8,240,103,159,100,213,159,75,247,56,211,188,134,128,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
