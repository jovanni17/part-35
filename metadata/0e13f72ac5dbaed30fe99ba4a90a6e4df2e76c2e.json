Only a victory there would determine which of the two powers would remain.\r\nThe Carthaginian Campaign\r\nFor generations the city of Carthage was seen as the most powerful in the known world and its empire â€“ far greater than anyone could imagine. That would soon change with the Roman invasion. Though the Carthaginian empire would rise once more. Led by its greatest general â€“ Hannibal â€“ who would bring Rome to its knees.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nOperating System: MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® 98/ 2000 / ME / XP / Vista / Windows7\r\nProcessor: 1 GHz CPU or above\r\nMemory: 128 MB RAM\r\nHard Disk Space: 1 GB\r\nVideo Card: DirectX compatible\r\nSound Card: DirectX compatible\r\nDirectXÂ® Version: DirectXÂ® 9.0c","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e13f72ac5dbaed30fe99ba4a90a6e4df2e76c2e","amp;dn":"Nemesis+of+the+Roman+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e13f72ac5dbaed30fe99ba4a90a6e4df2e76c2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,19,247,42,197,219,174,211,15,233,155,164,169,10,110,77,242,231,108,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
