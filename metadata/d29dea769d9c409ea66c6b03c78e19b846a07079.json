Lily Bart, beautiful, witty, and sophisticated, is accepted by &quot;old money&quot; and courted by the growing tribe of nouveaux riches. But as she nears 30, her foothold becomes precarious; a poor girl with expensive tastes, she needs a husband to preserve her social standing and to maintain her life in the luxury she has come to expect. While many have sought her, somethingÃ¢â‚¬â€fastidiousness or integrityÃ¢â‚¬â€prevents her from making a &quot;suitable&quot; match.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d29dea769d9c409ea66c6b03c78e19b846a07079","amp;dn":"Edith+Wharton%2C+The+House+of+Mirth+mobi+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d29dea769d9c409ea66c6b03c78e19b846a07079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,157,234,118,157,156,64,158,166,108,107,3,199,142,25,184,70,160,112,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
