His musical career includes forming 1970s and 1980s New Zealand rock group Split Enz, a number of solo albums, temporary membership in his brother Neil's band Crowded House and his joint efforts with Neil Finn as the Finn Brothers.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Tim Finn&quot; is the self-titled album by New Zealand singer/songwriter Tim Finn. After having little success with his previous album Big Canoe, Tim signed up with Capitol Records, for which he released 3 albums.\n\nWhile much of Tim's fan base regards this album as his finest accomplishment, it went largely unnoticed outside of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAfter this album, Tim &amp; younger brother Neil decided to record a Finn Brothers album. Crowded House drummer Paul Hester was present for the demo recordings of several tracks that were eventually incorporated (along with Tim himself) into the Crowded House album &quot;Woodface&quot;. This was Tim's second album with Capitol.\n\nThe 3rd album released on the Capitol label was &quot;Before &amp; After&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cba2f2b26f624ea225577f6a07721d58f34ffad3","amp;dn":"Tim+Finn+-+Tim+Finn+%5B1989%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cba2f2b26f624ea225577f6a07721d58f34ffad3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,162,242,178,111,98,78,162,37,87,127,106,7,114,29,88,243,79,250,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
