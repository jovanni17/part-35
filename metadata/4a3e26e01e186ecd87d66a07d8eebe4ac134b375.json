Van Gogh's work hangs here in the company of paintings by his friends Emile Bernard, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Paul Gauguin. The museum also presents a survey of the 19th-century art that preceded and inspired Van Gogh, such as landscapes from the School of Barbizon, and realistic depictions of peasant life by Jean Millet and Jules Breton. Finally, such Impressionists as Claude Monet and Symbolists like Odilon Redon can also be admired here. The collection is regularly enriched with new acquisitions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a3e26e01e186ecd87d66a07d8eebe4ac134b375","amp;dn":"Van+Gogh+Museum+-+Guide+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a3e26e01e186ecd87d66a07d8eebe4ac134b375","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,62,38,224,30,24,110,205,135,214,106,7,216,238,190,74,193,52,179,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
