But what is astonishingÃ¢â‚¬â€and should make us not just afraid but very afraidÃ¢â‚¬â€are the shenanigans of the biggest banks since the crisis. Bob Ivry passionately, eloquently, and convincingly details the operatic ineptitude of America's best-compensated executives and the ways the government kowtows to what it mistakenly imagines is their competence and success. Ivry shows that the only thing that has changed since the meltdown is how too-big-to-fail banks and their fellow travelers in Washington have nudged us ever closer to an even bigger economic calamity.\nInformed by deep reporting from New York, Washington, and the heartland, The Seven Sins of Wall Street, like no other book, shows how weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all affected by the financial industryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inhumanity. The transgressions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wall Street titansÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“masters of the universeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are paid for by real people. In fierce, plain English, Ivry indicts a financial industry that continues to work for the few at the expense of the rest of us. Problems that financiers deemed too complicated to be understood by ordinary folks are shown by Ivry to be financial legerdemainÃ¢â‚¬â€a smokescreen of complexity and jargon that hide the bankersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ nefarious activities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:570ccfeb894fd2ac8ad8e058c2f397453a4328c9","amp;dn":"The+Seven+Sins+of+Wall+Street%3A+Big+Banks%2C+their+Washington+Lacke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"570ccfeb894fd2ac8ad8e058c2f397453a4328c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,12,207,235,137,79,210,172,138,216,224,88,194,243,151,69,58,67,40,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
