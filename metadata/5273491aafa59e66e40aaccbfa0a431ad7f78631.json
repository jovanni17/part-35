Ambrosio, Ph.D.\n\nGeorgetown University\n\n\n\nWhat is the meaning of life? Is human existence meaningful or absurd? Is it even worth asking this kind of question? Anyone who has ever pondered these fundamental questions has an extraordinary adventure in store.\n\nIn 36 inspiring lectures, award-winning Professor of Philosophy Francis J. Ambrosio fields the biggest of the &quot;big&quot; questions, in a boldly revealing inquiry into one of the most fundamental of all human concerns.\n\nPhilosophy, Religion, and the Meaning of Life charts how the question of life's meaning has been pursued through the ages, highlighting the Western philosophical and religious paths in the human search for meaningful living.\n\nEmbracing a wide range of perspectives, Professor Ambrosio demonstrates that whether we are philosophically inclined or not, religious or atheistic, cynic or optimist, the question of life's meaning is shared universally by human beings, as an essential dynamic of human existence itself.\n\nIn revealing the ways in which our civilization has grasped the question of meaning and by proposing a specific type of purposeful inquiry, these lectures provide you with the tools to come to terms with the question in a direct, practical way. Philosophy, Religion, and the Meaning of Life delivers a clear and useable framework for both understanding the history of the human path to meaning and for navigating that path as an individual, personal concern.\n\n\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n36 Lectures \n30 minutes / lecture\n1.\tMeaningÃ¢â‚¬â€A Question and a Commitment\n2.\tHero and SaintÃ¢â‚¬â€Mapping the Cultural Genome\n3.\tThe Heroic AgeÃ¢â‚¬â€The Greek Worldview\n4.\tHeroism and the Tragic View of Life\n5.\tPlatoÃ¢â‚¬â€Politics, Justice, and Philosophy\n6.\tPlato's RepublicÃ¢â‚¬â€The Hero's Reward\n7.\tThe Heroic Ideal in Late Stoicism\n8.\t&quot;In the Beginning&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€The Hebrew Worldview\n9.\tFather Abraham, the First Saint\n10.\tSaintly Types in the Hebrew Bible\n11.\tJesus as Saintly InnovatorÃ¢â‚¬â€Forgiving Love\n12.\tHero or Saint?
