Love lost. More than once. The first love was as a child, another 6 year old who gave us attention for reasons we did not understand. We shunned them. Then in our early teens someone we really cared about then disposed of them once we had them. Then a couple years later someone had our hearts then threw us away just as easily. Then maybe fiance's or marriage, and the other person shut us out and gave attention to others.\n\nWhat I'm saying is this song can rip your heart out. What's left of your heart. As you realize that depth of love is for others. Never for you.\n\nIf you are lucky and have this thing you cherish do not ever take it for granted and do not ever stop fighting to keep it.\n\nSo for the rest of us? We are pirates.  Go grab that other pirate and make it a night the other person will never forget. At least we got that.[/i]\n\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/RsYC19o34G.jpg[/img]\n[b]Kool &amp; The Gang - Cherish[/b]\n\nLet's take a walk together near the ocean shore\nHand in hand, you and I\nLet's cherish every moment we have been given\nFor time is passing by\n\nI often pray before I lay down by your side\nIf you receive your calling before I awake\nCould I make it through the night\n\nCherish the love we have\nWe should cherish the life we live (oh)\nCherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love\n\nThe world is always changing, nothing stays the same\nBut love will stand the test of time\nThe next life that we live in remains to be seen\nWill you be by my side\n\nI often pray before I lay down by your side\nAnd if you receive your calling before I awake\nCould I make it through the night?\n\nCherish the love we have\nWe should cherish the life we live (Baby, yeah)\nCherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love\n\nCherish the love we have\n(Let's cherish every moment we have together)\nFor as long as we both shall live\n(Hand in hand, you and I)\nCherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love\n\n(Spoken:)\nCherish the love\nCherish the life\n\nCherish the love we have\nWe should cherish the life we live\nCherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love\n\nCherish the love we have\nFor as long as we both shall live\nCherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love\n\nCherish the love we have\n(Let's cherish every moment we have together)\nWe should cherish the life we live\n(Hand in hand, you and I)\nCherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa8d39444808dbf80523713f65bac7bc74a4dcf6","amp;dn":"Kool+%26amp%3B+The+Gang+-+Cherish+%28Big+Papi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa8d39444808dbf80523713f65bac7bc74a4dcf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,141,57,68,72,8,219,248,5,35,113,63,101,186,199,188,116,164,220,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
