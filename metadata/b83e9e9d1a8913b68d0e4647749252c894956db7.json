His heart and attention were given away a long time ago to his one and only loveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦his music. Years of fame have finally forced him into his own world of exile, a life he has become all too comfortable with.\n\nEnter Jordy Wilson, the 'a little too beautiful' girl next door, who catches the eye of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest superstar. A chance meeting leads the two down the rabbit hole and into the wake of destruction, a self-created train wreck of who they really are. Neither willing to rip themselves away, they move slowly toward each other, battling each others' demons. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left is a story of love, torment, lust and to question the ability to know when to say when. Enter the mind of a legend and the heart of the woman who loves him.\n\nAsk yourselfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ what if you were the exception? \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b83e9e9d1a8913b68d0e4647749252c894956db7","amp;dn":"Titan+by+Kate+Stewart.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b83e9e9d1a8913b68d0e4647749252c894956db7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,62,158,157,26,137,19,182,141,14,70,71,116,146,82,200,148,149,109,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
