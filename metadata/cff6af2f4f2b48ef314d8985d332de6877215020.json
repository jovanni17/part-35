It has words by English author Eleanor Farjeon and is set to a traditional Gaelic tune known as &quot;Bunessan&quot; (it shares this tune with the 19th century Christmas Carol &quot;Child in the Manger&quot;). It is often sung in children's services. English pop musician and folk singer Cat Stevens included a version on his 1971 album Teaser and the Firecat. The song became identified with Stevens when it reached number six on the US pop chart and number one on the US easy listening chart in 1972.\n\nWriting credit for &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; has occasionally been erroneously attributed to Cat Stevens, who popularised the song abroad. The familiar piano arrangement on Stevens' recording was performed by Rick Wakeman, a classically trained keyboardist with the English progressive rock band Yes.\n\nIn 2000, Wakeman released an instrumental version of &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; on an album of the same title. That same year he gave an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live in which he said he had agreed to perform on the Cat Stevens track for ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£10 and was &quot;shattered&quot; to be omitted from the credits, adding that he never received the money either.\n\nApparently where &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; is concerned, all Cat Stevens had was a hymn which lasted around 45 seconds. Producer Paul Samwell-Smith told him he could never put something like that on an album, that it needed at least to be three minutes in length. Prior to the actual recording Stevens heard Wakeman play something in the recording booth. It was a rough sketch of what would later become ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Catherine Howard&quot;. Stevens told Wakeman that he liked it and wanted something similar as the opening section, the closing section and, if possible, a middle section as well. Wakeman told Stevens he could not as it was his piece destined for a solo album, but Stevens persuaded him and got him as far as adapting his own composition. The familiar piano intro and general structure of the piece may be attributed to Stevens or to Wakeman.\n\nTeaser and the Firecat is an album released by Cat Stevens in 1971. It contains 10 songs including hits such as &quot;Morning Has Broken,&quot; &quot;Moonshadow,&quot; and &quot;Peace Train.&quot; It is also the title of a children's book written and illustrated by Cat Stevens. The story features the title characters from the album cover, top-hatted young Teaser and his pet Firecat, who attempt to put the moon back in its place after it falls from the sky. Published in 1972, the book has been out of print since the mid-1970s.\n\nThe album was a commercial success, surpassing the heights achieved by Stevens' previous album, Tea for the Tillerman, reaching both the UK and US Top 3 and also spending an impressive fifteen weeks at the top of the Australian charts, becoming the biggest-selling album of the country in 1972.\n\nIn 1977 an animated version, narrated by Spike Milligan and using the song Moonshadow, was a segment in Fantastic Animation Festival.\n\nIn November 2008, a 'Deluxe Edition' was released featuring a second disc of demos and live recordings.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cff6af2f4f2b48ef314d8985d332de6877215020","amp;dn":"Cat++Stevens++-+Morning+Has+Broken+%28Live%29+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cff6af2f4f2b48ef314d8985d332de6877215020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,246,175,47,79,43,72,239,49,77,137,133,211,50,222,104,119,33,80,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
