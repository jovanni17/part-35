The legendary guitarist gets them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ like, really gets them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ more than most. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe blues are a fact of life,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he adds in a Dayton, Ohio twang undiminished by two decades of UK living. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t matter where you are. The blues have no boundaries.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ An old school bluesman in the tradition of everyone from, say, Howling Wolf and Leadbelly to Blind Willie Johnson, McDonald channels the past into the future through his internationally regarded project, Little Axe. \nA project that is more than just a band: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a collective of different people who, at certain periods, come together to create great work.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Founded in the early 1990s, with five acclaimed albums to their credit, Little Axe are redefining the blues for the current generation. \n\nTheir melting pot is large, and bubbling. Here are addictive rhythms. Soulful vocals. Pinches of dub and funk, reggae and gospel. Oh-so-subtle samples and innovative electronics. And underpinning it all, McDonaldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shimmering blues guitar licks, conjuring a space where the dirt roads of the Deep South meet the shiny lanes of the Information Superhighway. \n\nTracklist\n1.
