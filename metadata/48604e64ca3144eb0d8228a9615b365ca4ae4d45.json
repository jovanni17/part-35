For quite some time, I've been looking to put together an electronic track somewhat in the vein of Orbital's &quot;Halcyon + On + On&quot;. There's nothing quite like the feeling and emotion that song provides. I wanted to create my own &quot;Halcyon&quot;, and this song was it. I put it together in February and March of 2012 and released it on March 20 on the Bandcamp page. I made the no-leads version of the track available as a free download, and the original version with a couple bonus items available for $1.\n\nÃ¢â„¢Â¦ Track listing:\n1. 808 Star Symphony\n2. 808 Star Symphony (no leads)\n3. 808 Star Symphony (hidden mix) [hidden track]\n\nÃ¢â„¢Â¦ Personnel:\nJoseph Kenyon - all music and sounds\n\nÃ¢â„¢Â¦ First Released: March 20, 2012\nFormat: Digital Download (free/paid)\nLabel: Rain Music Group","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48604e64ca3144eb0d8228a9615b365ca4ae4d45","amp;dn":"Ruined+Machines+-+808+Star+Symphony+%282012%29+320+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48604e64ca3144eb0d8228a9615b365ca4ae4d45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,96,78,100,202,49,68,235,13,130,40,169,97,91,54,92,164,174,77,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
