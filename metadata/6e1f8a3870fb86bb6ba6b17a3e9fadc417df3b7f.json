Investigating these unusual occurrences is the newly-formed United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT for short).\nLed by Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, UNIT is soon called into action when people and meteorites start going missing.\n\nMost puzzling of all is the attempted kidnapping of a strange hospital patient: a man with two hearts, who insists that he knows the Brigadier.\n\nThe new Doctor soon joins forces with his old friend, UNIT and the recently recruited Doctor Elizabeth Shaw, but time is running out. Irregular things are happening at a nearby plastics factory, while faceless creatures lurk in the woods. The Nestenes have arrived, and want to conquer the Earth...\n\n\nI believe this is the only classic Doctor Who story released on Blu Ray because the transfer actually came from one of the two times Doctor Who was shot on 16 mm film.\n\n960 x 720, 25 FPS\n\nIf anyone has the raw VIDEO_TS files for The Time Monster, please upload them. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e1f8a3870fb86bb6ba6b17a3e9fadc417df3b7f","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Spearhead+From+Space","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e1f8a3870fb86bb6ba6b17a3e9fadc417df3b7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,31,138,56,112,251,134,187,107,166,177,122,62,159,173,196,23,223,59,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
