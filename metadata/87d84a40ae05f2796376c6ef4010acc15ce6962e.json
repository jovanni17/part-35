R. Martin. Martin began writing the series in 1991 and the first volume was published in 1996. Originally planned as a trilogy, the series now consists of four published volumes with the fifth expected to be published in 2011 on July 12 and two more planned. There are also three prequel novellas available, with several more planned, and a series of novellas consisting of excerpts of the main novels. One of these excerpt novellas has won a Hugo Award. The series has been translated into more than 20 languages and the fourth volume reached the top of The New York Times bestseller lists upon its release.\nOverall, the series has more than 4.5 million copies in print in the USA  and sold more than 7 million worldwide.\n\nThe story of A Song of Ice and Fire takes place in a fictional world, primarily upon a continent called Westeros but also on a large landmass to the east, known as Essos. Most of the characters are human but as the series progresses other races are introduced, such as the cold and menacing Others from the far North and fire-breathing dragons from the East, both races thought to be extinct by the people of the story. There are three principal storylines in the series: the chronicling of a dynastic civil war for control of Westeros among several competing families; the rising threat of the Others, who dwell beyond an immense wall of ice that forms Westeros' northern border; and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the exiled daughter of a king who was murdered in another civil war 15 years previously, to return to Westeros and claim her rightful throne. As the series progresses, all three storylines become increasingly interwoven and dependent on each other.\n\nThe series is told in the third-person through the eyes of a number of point of view characters. By the end of the fourth volume, there have been 17 such characters with multiple chapters and eight who only have one chapter apiece.\nThe growing popularity of the series led to it being optioned by HBO for development of a television adaptation, named Game of Thrones. A pilot episode was produced in 2009 and a series commitment for nine further episodes was made in March 2010. The series premiered on April 17, 2011, and two days later, the network picked the show up for a second season.\n\nPLEASE SEED AFTER DOWNLOAD!\n\n-CHOSEN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d84a40ae05f2796376c6ef4010acc15ce6962e","amp;dn":"George+R.+R.+Martin+%3A+A+Song+of+Ice+and+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d84a40ae05f2796376c6ef4010acc15ce6962e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,216,74,64,174,5,242,121,99,118,198,239,64,16,172,193,92,230,150,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
