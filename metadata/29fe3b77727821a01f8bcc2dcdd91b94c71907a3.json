This text has invited more than 4 million students into the study of this dynamic and essential discipline.The authors have restructured each chapter around a conceptual framework of five or six big ideas. An Overview draws students in and sets the stage for the rest of the chapter, each numbered Concept Head announces the beginning of a new concept, and Concept Check questions at the end of each chapter encourage students to assess their mastery of a given concept. New Inquiry Figures focus students on the experimental process, and new Research Method Figures illustrate important techniques in biology. Each chapter ends with a Scientific Inquiry Question that asks students to apply scientific investigation skills to the content of the chapter. \n\nI found this from another tracker, thank to the guy who spent 6 hours to scan and 3 hours to edit  \nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29fe3b77727821a01f8bcc2dcdd91b94c71907a3","amp;dn":"Biology+%287th+Ed%29%28Hard+cover%29+by+Neil+A.+Campbell%2C+Jane+B.+Reece","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29fe3b77727821a01f8bcc2dcdd91b94c71907a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,254,59,119,114,120,33,160,31,139,204,45,205,217,27,148,199,25,7,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
