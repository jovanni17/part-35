It was released on August 28, 2001 on Lava Records,[1] and it features their one-off hit, Shaniqua.\n\nThe band describes &quot;Fome&quot; as &quot;Dancin' in your house in your underwear, playin' air guitar to a stadium of teddy bears. Or goin' to work, headphones on, ignoring what your boss says, singin' along&quot;, and &quot;Dape&quot; as &quot;An adjective synonymous with absolute glory, kinda like great, super-fly, hype, fresh, bigger than big, better than best&quot;.\n\nRearrange the vowels in the title and you have its true meaning, &quot;Fame is Dope.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nI could not grab the music video of Shaniqua because the video actually isn't on the CD. There is software that redirects you to a website with the video and that website doesn't exist anymore. If you have the high quality version of the video please leave a comment\n\n1.Intro\n2.Fome Is Dape\n3.Immune\n4.Wings\n5.Loosendin'\n6.Kick in the Ass\n7.Sammy\n8.A Little More\n9.Untitled\n10.J\n11.Only When It Rains\n12.Guidance Counselor\n13.Shaniqua\n14.Deadman\n15.Sycamore Trees\n16.Outro\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nWriting library                          : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b32220ba321bdf63cdd0adf7ecc04936112610","amp;dn":"Little-T+and+One+Track+Mike+-+Fome+Is+Dape%5B2001%5DFLAC.Explicit-r3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b32220ba321bdf63cdd0adf7ecc04936112610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,179,34,32,186,50,27,223,99,205,208,173,247,236,192,73,54,17,38,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
