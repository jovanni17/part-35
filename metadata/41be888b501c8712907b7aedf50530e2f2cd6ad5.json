In particular, basic circuit elements and their characteristics are presented when connected in an electric network. In addition, techniques to analyse and solve electric circuits are explained in a simple manner and examples are shown to demonstrate each strategy. DC as well as AC circuit analysis is provided with a brief account of filters in the end. Difficult electric circuit concepts such as sinusoids and phasors are explicated in an effective way so that basic understanding can be properly achieved.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41be888b501c8712907b7aedf50530e2f2cd6ad5","amp;dn":"Concepts+in+Electric+Circuits+%282009%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41be888b501c8712907b7aedf50530e2f2cd6ad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,190,136,139,80,28,135,18,144,123,122,237,245,5,48,226,242,205,106,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
