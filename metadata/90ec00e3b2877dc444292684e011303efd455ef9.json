I've also added higher quality textures for classic models, armored froglok models, removed a few annoying sounds like thunder and pet laughing, and added a great custom interface that is optional to use.\n\nInstallation instructions : \n1. Unzip this bad boy to your C drive. \n\n2. Go inside the folder and find EQGAME.EXE, right click it make a shortcut for your desktop. \nIt is very critical that you choose EQGAME.EXE instead of EVERQUEST.EXE, because choosing the wrong one will open up the patcher and fuck up your installation.\n\n3. Right click your new desktop shortcut and add patchme to the end of your target box.
