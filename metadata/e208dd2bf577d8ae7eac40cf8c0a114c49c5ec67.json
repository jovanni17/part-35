The other players are the â€œExpertsâ€ who must give the instructions to defuse the bomb by deciphering the information found in the bomb defusal manual. But thereâ€™s a catch: the experts canâ€™t see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out â€“ fast!\r\n\r\nRounds are fast-paced, tense, occasionally silly, and almost always loud. Everybody has a role to play whether they are defusing the bomb or not. Swap out between rounds and share the experience with all of your friends!\r\n\r\nPuzzle solving and communication skills - and maybe a few friendships - will be put to the test as players race to defuse bombs while communicating quickly, clearly, and effectively","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e208dd2bf577d8ae7eac40cf8c0a114c49c5ec67","amp;dn":"Keep+Talking+and+Nobody+Explodes+v1.0.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e208dd2bf577d8ae7eac40cf8c0a114c49c5ec67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,8,221,43,245,119,216,174,126,172,64,207,140,10,17,76,73,197,236,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
