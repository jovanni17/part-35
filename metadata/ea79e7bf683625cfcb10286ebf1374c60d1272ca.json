The author has been visiting Italy, for study, for work, and for pleasure, for over fifty years, and is the perfect companion for those who want to know about more than the obvious attractions.\n\nAs well as comprehensively covering the finest sights in the major tourist centers of Rome, Florence, Venice, and elsewhere, Francis Russell discusses and describes the neglected, or little-known, masterpieces that are still to be found the length and breadth of the Italian peninsula. In a book that will educate and astonish the expert as surely as it will guide and inform the first-time visitor, the author chooses and explores palaces and gardens, city squares and lonely churches, frescoes and altarpieces, great museums and tiny ruins that together provide a richly textured portrait of a country where the history and patterns of civilization lie more thickly than anywhere else on earth.\n\nThis book will immeasurably enhance and enrich the visitor's experience of the most visited country in the world, by virtue of its sensitivity, its wisdom, and its deep knowledge, and by means of its vivid, eloquent, and entertaining exposition.\n\nFrancis Russell was educated at Oxford. He is deputy chairman of Christies and specializes in Old Master and Italian paintings.\n\n&quot;The author has achieved the near impossibleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a must-squeeze-into-hand-baggage or the back pack.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€House and Garden\n\n&quot;A minor classic.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€The Times Literary Supplement\n\nInteres","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea79e7bf683625cfcb10286ebf1374c60d1272ca","amp;dn":"101+Places+in+Italy+-+A+Private+Grand+Tour%2C+1001+Unforgettable+W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea79e7bf683625cfcb10286ebf1374c60d1272ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,121,231,191,104,54,37,207,203,16,40,110,191,19,116,198,13,18,114,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
