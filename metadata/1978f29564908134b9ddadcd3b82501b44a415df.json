Charlap's driving hard bop interpretation of Ornette Coleman's blues &quot;Turnaround&quot; is a gem, as are his lyrical arrangements of Benny Carter's gorgeous ballad &quot;Souvenir&quot; and Phil Woods' memorable tribute &quot;Goodbye Mr. Evans.&quot; His playful side comes across in his obtuse approaches to Charlie Parker's &quot;Confirmation&quot; and Jim Hall's &quot;Waltz New&quot; (which is a reworking of the chord changes to &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;). The only standard of the session is an extended treatment of &quot;Alone Together,&quot; which begins with a haunting solo by the leader before evolving into an intense, introspective workout by the trio. This very enjoyable date is highly recommended.
