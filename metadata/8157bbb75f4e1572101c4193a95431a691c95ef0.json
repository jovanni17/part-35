Its blend of rock, rhythm and blues, jazz, country, and gospel helped establish the Southern Rock genre in the early 1970s.\nWhile the band had reached the height of its commercial success by the end of the decade, it has recorded and performed continuously under various lineups for nearly 40 years.\nThe original group included lead guitarist, vocalist, and primary songwriter Toy Caldwell (1947Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1993), keyboard player and vocalist Doug Gray, flutist Jerry Eubanks, rhythm guitarist George McCorkle (1946Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2007), drummer Paul Riddle, and bassist Tommy Caldwell (1949Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1980)\nHomepage:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.marshalltucker.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.marshalltucker.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n[From Wikipedia]\n\nCheck the INFO file for more details about this torrent\nand....\ndon't make me plead, please seed!\n\n- THOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nI used to be schizophrenic, but we're OK now\n\n Ciao from the italian Alps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8157bbb75f4e1572101c4193a95431a691c95ef0","amp;dn":"MARSHALL+TUCKER+BAND+-+A+Taste+by+Pete+Hollow+-+mp3%40320+%5BTNT+Vil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8157bbb75f4e1572101c4193a95431a691c95ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,87,187,183,95,78,21,114,16,28,65,147,169,84,49,166,145,201,94,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
