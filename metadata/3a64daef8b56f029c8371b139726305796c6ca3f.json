In the film both types of 'conservatives' are portrayed as full of fear and hate toward the unconventional ways of the counterculture; and filled with envy at their free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counterculture is portrayed as mocking the straight culture; and although paranoid toward conservatives (legitimately so given that this was just a couple months after Kent State) they cannot resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize. The political landscape is not all that different 30+ years later. I'm not sure conservatives envy young people and liberals as much as 1970, but they fear and hate them more.\n\nAn excellent film that surprisingly is as relevant now as it was in the early 1970's.&quot; \n         (www.imdb.com)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065916/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065916/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a64daef8b56f029c8371b139726305796c6ca3f","amp;dn":"Joe.1970.DVDRip.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a64daef8b56f029c8371b139726305796c6ca3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,100,218,239,139,86,240,41,200,55,27,19,151,38,48,87,150,198,202,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
