By then, he had left his native New Orleans for Marshall, TX. After World War II ended, he played local dances and clubs around Dallas and crossed paths with T-Bone Walker. Sims cut his first 78s for Herb Rippa's Blue Bonnet Records in 1948 in Dallas, but didn't taste anything resembling regional success until 1953, when his bouncy &quot;Lucy Mae Blues&quot; did well down south.\n\nThe guitarist recorded fairly prolifically for Los Angeles-based Specialty into 1954, then switched to Johnny Vincent's Ace label (and its Vin subsidiary) in 1957. \n\nSims mostly missed out on the folk-blues revival of the early '60s that his cousin Lightnin' Hopkins cashed in on . When he died at age 53 in Dallas of pneumonia, Sims was reportedly in trouble with the law due to a shooting incident and had been dogged by drinking problems. ~ Bill Dahl, All Music Guide \n\nThis contains Frankie Lee Sims' complete Specialty output, recorded 1953-1954.\n\n\nPersonnel: Frankie Lee Sims vocals gtr, Hubert Washington (drums).\n\n\n1.Lucy Mae Blues \n2.Don't Take It Out on Me \n3.Married Woman\n4.Wine and Gin Bounce - (previously unreleased) \n5.Boogie 'Cross the Country \nRoll Baker \n7.I'm So Glad\n 8.Long Gone \n9.Raggedy and Dirty \n10.Yeh, Baby! \n11.No Good Woman - (previously unreleased) \n12.Walking Boogie (Take 4) - (previously unreleased, Take 4) \n13.Frankie's Blues \n14.Cryin' Won't Help You \n15.I Done Talked and I Done Talked \n16.Lucy Mae Blues, Pt. 2\n17.Rhumba My Boogie \n18.I'll Get Along Somehow \n19.Hawk Shuffle - (previously unreleased) \n20.Frankie Lee's 2 O'Clock Jump - (previously unreleased)\n\nAll songs written by Frankie Lee Sims.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f85b9a869caf054801de3a0fc688c42afc3d182b","amp;dn":"Frankie+Lee+Sims+Lucy+Mae+Biues%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f85b9a869caf054801de3a0fc688c42afc3d182b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,91,154,134,156,175,5,72,1,222,58,15,198,136,196,42,252,61,24,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
