A lone meteorologist and petroleum engineer must battle the elements to stop the threat.A group of oil drillers off the shore of south California accidentally drills to close to the EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core causing a volcano eruption. Since the eruption occurred at the bottom of the ocean, it creates one super cyclone that is going to destroy most of California. The only hope is a group of oil drillers (who do absolutely nothing but run around the oil rig), Dr. Jenna Sparks (played by Ming-Na), and Travis Verdon (played by Nicholas Turturro). \n\nGenre: Action \nIMDB rating: 1.4/10 from 91 users \nDirected by: Liz Adams \nStarring: Nicholas Turturro, Ming-Na and Andy Clemence \n\nRelease Name: Super Cyclone 2012 720p BRRip x264 AC3-Freebee \nSize: 1.722 GB \nVideo: XViD | 1280Ãƒâ€”720 | 23.976fps \nAudio: English | AC3 | 48000 Hz \nRuntime: 90 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f975886049432f0cbf01e6e627c35f6aa3da6635","amp;dn":"Super+Cyclone+2012+720p+BRRip+x264+AC3-Freebee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f975886049432f0cbf01e6e627c35f6aa3da6635","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,117,136,96,73,67,47,12,191,1,230,230,39,195,95,106,163,218,102,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
