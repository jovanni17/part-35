There are several books providing context on the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, and a few that focus on Dr. Martin Luther King. But, without seeking to diminish King's legacy, there are others who made pivotal contributions. A. Philip Randolph, whose efforts prodded FDR and laid the groundwork for the struggle throughout the twentieth century, deserves more attention. But this torrent is dedicated to the honorable memory of Bayard Rustin, the man who taught MLK the principles of Gandhi, who organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and though he was one of the first to protest the war in Vietnam, he muted his outcry to foster domestic development. He was a man of vision and courage and a great American. May he always be remembered and accorded the honor he deserves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a6fd0695de3df30d38e87299399296e9fec43fa","amp;dn":"New+perspectives+on+the+Civil+Rights+Movement","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a6fd0695de3df30d38e87299399296e9fec43fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,111,208,105,93,227,223,48,211,142,135,41,147,153,41,110,159,236,67,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
