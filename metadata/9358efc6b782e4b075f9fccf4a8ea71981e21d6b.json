The articles that appear in the Bulletin are of high quality, are well written and appeal to a broad mathematical audience. The Bulletin concentrates on the publication of shorter research articles, authoritative survey articles, book reviews, and occasional biographical articles on the lives and achievements of distinguished mathematicians","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9358efc6b782e4b075f9fccf4a8ea71981e21d6b","amp;dn":"Bulletin+of+the+London+Mathematical+Society+%281969-1992%29.RAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9358efc6b782e4b075f9fccf4a8ea71981e21d6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,88,239,198,183,130,228,176,117,249,252,207,74,142,167,25,129,226,29,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
