Then things get murky. Jazz Inc., which is featured here in its entirety, was actually recorded by the Tony Crombie Orchestra, of which Tracey was a part. The other music here includes four tunes by Tracey's Quartet with Tubby Hayes, some selections from Tracey with the Harry Klein Quartet, and a few from his tenure as a sideman in yet another group led by American guitarist Jon Wheatley. The back sleeve has an interesting typo: it claims that Jazz Inc. is comprised of tracks 1-28 on disc two, but there are only 16 selections on the disc. In any case, there are completely new liner notes as well as reproductions of the originals, and a fine remastering job was done; all sold for a very respectable price tag. As an introduction to one of British jazz's great original voices, this is truly worthy.
