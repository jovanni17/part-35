Galactic Civilizations II also features a vastly overhauled and scalable graphics engine that now runs in 3D (yet is still playable on low-end systems.) \n\n\nExtract Archive To Any Desired Directory With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\n\nNO INSTALL JUST EXTRACT AND PLAY \n\nStart Game With &quot;GalCiv2.exe&quot; \n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b2db1300ae547b5d8794b7e287c812f29b11aec","amp;dn":"Galactic.Civilizations.II.Dread.Lords.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%E2%84%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b2db1300ae547b5d8794b7e287c812f29b11aec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,45,177,48,10,229,71,181,216,121,75,126,40,124,129,47,41,177,26,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
