This was first printed in the pages of Green Lantern Secret Files and Origins back in 2005 and can also be found in the trade paperback &quot;Green Lantern No Fear&quot;.\n I would like to thank the publishers an the artist of the source material for all their hard work, and I would also like to extend my gratitude to the musical group Pink Floyd, their beautiful compositions have always been a personal inspiration and I have been wanting to use their work in one of these motion comics for years now. Also a huge thank you to the voice actors who helped make this project come together so quickly, we got this project to fly (see what I did there?) in just over one week.
