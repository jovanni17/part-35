The actual title is &quot;Song from M*A*S*H (Suicide is Painless)&quot;. Mike Altman is the son of the original filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s director, Robert Altman, and was 14 years old when he wrote the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics. During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in the 1980s, Robert Altman said that his son had earned more than a million US dollars for having co-written the song while he only made US$70,000 for having directed the movie. \n    The song is played during the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening credits, sung by uncredited session singers John Bahler, Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Ian Freebairn-Smith. Credited to &quot;The Mash&quot; when it appeared on the film's soundtrack album on Columbia/CBS Records in 1970, it belatedly became a number one hit in the UK in 1980 after being championed by BBC Radio 1 DJ Noel Edmonds. The song was ranked #66 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs.\n\n   Manic Street Preachers released a cover version of &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot; in 1992. In the UK it was a double A-side charity single  with The Fatima Mansions' take on Bryan Adams' &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; as the other A-side. The single peaked at #7 in the UK Singles Chart spending three weeks in the Top Ten. In other countries it was released as a Manic Street Preachers single, with different B-sides.\n\n   BarÃƒÂ°i JÃƒÂ³hannsson and Keren Ann recorded a version on their album &quot;Lady and Bird&quot; (2003).   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf29d99051bb28d6a4078f427faaeadc43b7ab5","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+432","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf29d99051bb28d6a4078f427faaeadc43b7ab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,242,157,153,5,27,178,141,106,64,120,244,39,250,174,173,196,59,122,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
