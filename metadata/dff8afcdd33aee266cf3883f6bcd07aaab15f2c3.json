For the city's ultra-competitive elite, the club's ten annual spots are the ultimate parenting prize. But not everyone is PHM&amp;TC material. The club's founder, Bettina Connaught Cross, adheres to strict membership rules: Moms only. No single parents or working mothers allowed. Membership is an arduous commitment. And there's no room in the club for scandal, bad behavior, or imperfection...from tots or their moms. In a world of power and prestige, no one has more than Bettina. And as every mom in Pacific Heights knows, you simply cannot cross her. But this year's admissions process is more rigorous than ever, pitting prospective members against each other to prove their mettle. But four of the six candidates vying for the remaining four slots have a secret that would knock them out of the running. Jade is a former stripper and porn actress, who has been absent for most of her son's life. Jillian's husband cleaned out their joint accounts and left her for his pregnant assistant. Ally never even had a husband--just a sperm donor--and she's hiding a high-ranking corporate job. And Lorna fears that her son may have special needs... just the excuse her sister-in-law, Bettina, needs to deny her entry to the club. Can these hopeful moms keep up appearances long enough to outlast the competition? Or will their chances--and their private lives--go up in flames?\nFriendship. Lies. Seduction. Betrayal. Welcome to Totlandia.\n\n2 - Totlandia: Book 2: The Onesies - Winter\nFive mommies are just one misstep away from entry into the elite Pacific Heights Moms &amp; Tots Club. Everyone has a scandalous secret to hide, but who will be the next to fall? As the club's founder, Bettina, ratchets up the stress level with a series of holiday-themed challenges, the cracks begin to show. Jade's past catches up to her in the most unlikely of settings. Jillian's struggles to make ends meet are complicated by Bettina's demands. Ally's work and home lives collide, threatening to expose all of her secrets. And Lorna's already fraying family ties are torn to shreds by a series of devastating events. With just four spots remaining, will the five remaining ladies turn cutthroat? Or will their newfound friendships be strong enough to help them band together?\n\n3 - Totlandia: Book 3: The Onesies - Spring\nSpring comes in like a lamb as the exclusive Pacific Heights Moms &amp; Tots Club welcomes its newest members. But that tranquility belies a storm brewing, as new tensions and old rivalries come to a head. The surviving moms are ready to reap the rewards of membership, but none of them counted on club founder, Bettina Connaught Cross, needing a pick-me-up from a bitter betrayal. While lesser women might cry into their pillows, Bettina finds comfort in exerting control over her domain. With Bettina on a rampage, the new Onesies are trying to stay out of sight long enough to deal with their own issues: Lorna wants to tell her family about DanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s autism, but keeping it on her own terms could be difficult when her hippie mom and socialite mother-in-law meet for the first time. Jillian fights to regain her financial footing and confront her own insecurities, finding comfort in an unexpected place. And Ally canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bear the thought of hurting Jade, so she continues to bury her feelings for Brady. But when another desperate housewife stirs the mix, Jade could become a pawn in an even more devious game. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no ordinary spring in Totlandia, as emotions build to a fury and end with a roar.\n\n4 - Totlandia: Book 4: The Onesies - Summer\nAs summer sizzles in Totlandia, emotions boil over for the newest members of Pacific Heights Moms &amp; Tots Club, whose trust in each other is sorely tempted by Bettina and her club politics. When Jillian's vindictive joke backfires, she learns the true meaning of forgiveness. JadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s betrayal puts her in a dangerous downward spiral with no bottom in sightÃ¢â‚¬â€until she finds friendship and redemption where she least expects it. Lorna faces the biggest trial in her marriage, and makes an important decision that may end it for good. While Ally may regret the choices made she to get accepted in the club, her exile puts new opportunities in her path, thanks to Brady and his ceaseless desire to win her overÃ¢â‚¬â€with Barry's help, who is playing his own little game with the Top Moms Committee. But it's Bettina who suffers the ultimate punishmentÃ¢â‚¬â€one that changes her life, and the livelihood of the club, forever.\n\n\nNote:  More than most of the books that i have uploaded or will upload, i BUY and share (unless it is stated otherwise)..\nBook #1 was free on Amazon.
