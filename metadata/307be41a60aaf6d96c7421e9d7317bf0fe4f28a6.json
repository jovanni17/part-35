Having learned guitar and his wide-ranging stock of songs as a youth from family and 78-rpm recordings, he enthralled major audiences during more than three decades with his vintage style and repertoire. Culled from hundreds of live concert recordings in the Smithsonian Folkways archives, the twenty tracks of Rappahannock Blues highlight John Jackson the way he most wanted to be rememberedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as a bluesman. \nThis recording is the fifth in the Smithsonian Folkways African American Legacy Series, co-presented with the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\n\nTracklist\n1.
