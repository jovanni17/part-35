Connectify is an easy-to-use and reliable software router that makes use of your Wi-Fi card to share your Internet connection.\n\nOn the other hand, Connectify Dispatch will help you quickly and easily combine all your PCs Internet connections for blazing speeds. Dispatch is particularly well-suited for BitTorrent and web pages - any download that naturally involves multiple files.\n\nWhile monolithic streams like Netflix canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be split across connections, Dispatch will assign them to the fastest connection - and route other requests to secondary connections.\n\nWith Dispatch's metered connections you can avoid costly overages by assigning bandwidth caps to your expensive 3G and 4G connections. In addition by setting their Priority level to Backup, Dispatch will only route traffic through them if your Primary connections fail.\n\n\nRequirements:\nOS: Windows 7 / 7 64 bit / 8 / 8 64 bit\n- A laptop or PC with a compatible Wi-Fi card or adapter\n- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5\n\nHomePage - http://www.connectify.me/\n\n-:[Install Notes]:-\n\n:: Setup With Patch ::\n==&gt; DisConnect Internet\n==&gt; Install Program\n==&gt; When Finish Installation, ReStart PC\n==&gt; Disable/Push Your AntiVirus Protechtion\n==&gt; Run &amp; Apply Patch\n==&gt; Enjoy ...\n\n:: Setup With Activator ::\n1-install &quot;ConnectifyInstaller.exe&quot; .\n2-when finish install , close it , if ask for reboot cancel it , don't run it .\n3-run &quot;ConnectifyExit.bat&quot;\n4-run &quot;Connectify Activator.exe&quot; &amp; wait 1 Minute .\n5-restart your computer that's all .\n6-never update , cancel it .\nEnjoy.....\n\nPROGRAM PROVIDED FOR TEST PURPOSES ONLY!\nIF YOU LIKE THIS PROGRAM, SUPPORT DEVELOPERS, BUY IT!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2f97bbee369ae60bd1c6cf6d9648e553044adab","amp;dn":"Connectify+Hotspot+Dispatch+PRO+7.3.3.30440+With+Activator+%26amp%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2f97bbee369ae60bd1c6cf6d9648e553044adab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,249,123,190,227,105,174,96,189,28,108,246,217,100,142,85,48,68,173,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
