Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was released to volume license customers on November 30, 2006[1] and made available to retail customers on January 30, 2007. These are, respectively, the same dates Windows Vista was released to volume licensing and retail customers. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Fluent User Interface[2] (initially referred to as the Ribbon UI), replacing the menus and toolbars ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with a tabbed toolbar, known as the Ribbon. Office 2007 requires Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or higher, Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 or higher, or Windows Vista.[3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d11082b9333f91f29db5c1afb5e604f5af9216a2","amp;dn":"Office+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d11082b9333f91f29db5c1afb5e604f5af9216a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,16,130,185,51,63,145,242,157,181,193,175,181,230,4,245,175,146,22,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
