That being said, if there does happen to be a problem with an upload, then fall back to the previous version and NICELY let me know... I'll fix it as soon as I can.\n\n\nPlease DO NOT post comments about new updates. I check daily for updates and if I haven't posted a new version yet, I'll get to it when I get to it. \n\n\nPlease DO NOT make addon requests. The two most popular guides are Zygor and Dugi, and those are the ones that will be uploaded. (I'm working on Dugi currently.)\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\n\nVersion: 4.0.6209\nReleased on: March 29th, 2013\n[B] Reputations\nRearranged the Lorewalkers guide to be more efficient.\n\n[B] Achievements\nAdded in the option to choose the zone you wish to explore when opening up the Explorer guides.\n\n[B] Pets / Mounts\nRemoving manual go to steps.\n\n[B] Dailies/Reputations\nUpdated the Thunder Isle reputations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fa0ed78e38330b1ac10e5b12c2afaa7b49aef16","amp;dn":"Zygor+Guides+4.0.6209+%28March+29th%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fa0ed78e38330b1ac10e5b12c2afaa7b49aef16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,160,237,120,227,131,48,177,172,16,229,177,44,42,250,167,180,154,239,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
