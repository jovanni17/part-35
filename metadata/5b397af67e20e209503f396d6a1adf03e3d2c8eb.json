Without them I would not have been able to collect this many tracks [originally only 14 listed on Wikipedia].\n\nIf you have any complaints about quality let me remind you these songs are 80-100 years old and quality is as good as you're going to get. I tried my best to find better quality tracks where I could. Several of the YouTube sources had tracks joined together and I splitted whenever possible. Some track were not meant to be split so I left them be. For splitting tracks I used mp3 Splitter Joiner Pro, VirtualDJ Home Free. For conversion I used Freemake Audio Converter as well as a nifty site for converting Youtube videos to mp3.\n\nP.S. If I'm missing a few tracks or if there are any tracks that are misplaced please let me know. This is a fan-made collection. There are no official releases for Florrie Forde's complete works.\n\n::Album Info::\n==============\nAlbum Title: Florrie Forde Collection\nArtist | Group: Florrie Forde\nRelease date: 1903-1936\nGenre: Music Hall, Sing-A-Long\nNumber of track(s): 83\nFile format: mp3\nTotal duration: 04h:03m:24s:558ms\nTotal size: 235.0794 MB\n\n::Track List::\n==============\nDown At The Old Bull And Bush\nAnona\nFlo From Pimlico\nOh!
