This book contains over 500 patterns and designs from the finest Victorian source: just transfer the designs to cloth, select a color scheme, use your favorite stitches, and soon your very own personal &quot;needle painting&quot; will begin to form.\nThe designs are classified according to type, from large motifs to borders, centers, corners, scenes, and more. A wide variety of flowers, sprays, and greenery is included, usually in various combinations: daisies, tulips, peonies, dahlias, cornflowers, poppy, wheat, and more. There are also butterflies, bluebirds, bumblebees, owls, dragonflies, and insects of all sorts. Plus, you'll find geometric designs, dramatic sunbursts, and unusual beasts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:643247d1bd8915644afe477e0be9ddd8a749197f","amp;dn":"Designs+and+Patterns+for+Embroiderers+and+Craftspeople+-+Epub+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"643247d1bd8915644afe477e0be9ddd8a749197f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,50,71,209,189,137,21,100,74,254,71,126,11,233,221,216,167,73,25,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
