Eric and his gang have planned to raid the only bank in the city which is open on Bastille day. Zed is trapped in a situation beyond his control when heroin abuse, poor planning and a call-girl named Zoe all conspire to turn the robbery into a very bloody siege.\n\n\n\nFORMAT.......................: MP4\nCODEC........................: X264\nGENRE........................: Drama\nFILE SIZE....................: 789 MB\nRESOLUTION...................: 1280x688\nVIDEO BITRATE................: 949kbps\nFRAME RATE...................: 23.976 fps\nLANGUAGE.....................: English/French\nSUBTITLES....................: English for French parts only\nRUNTIME......................: 1:39:01\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\nThis is the Director's Cut of Killing Zoe. It is 3 minutes longer than the theatrical release. This is the only torrent I've seen that has English subtitles for the French portions of the movie, so please seed for as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.\n\nMy bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on &quot;normal&quot; sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who keep large collections of movies on their hard drives. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you're going to need one of the larger, higher bitrate torrents. For large screen TVs, I recommend bitrates of 2500 for 720p's and 5000 for 1080p's.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80b7145dd373d9197bb2277e5337ad04b7939591","amp;dn":"Killing+Zoe+%281993%29+%5B720p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80b7145dd373d9197bb2277e5337ad04b7939591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,183,20,93,211,115,217,25,123,178,39,126,83,55,173,4,183,147,149,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
