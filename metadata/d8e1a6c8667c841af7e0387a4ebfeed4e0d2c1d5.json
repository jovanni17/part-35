Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is no routine of an office to keep you going, only the blank page each morning, and you never know where your words are coming from, those divine words.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In The Spooky Art, Mailer discusses with signature candor the rewards and trials of the writing life, and recommends the tools to navigate it. Addressing the reader in a conversational tone, he draws on the best of more than fifty years of his own criticism, advice, and detailed observations about the writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s craft.\n\nPraise for The Spooky Art\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Spooky Art shows MailerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brave willingness to take on demanding forms and daunting issues. . . .
