Following many years of me pestering him,\nhe finally got around to getting the transfer done.\nPlease share this freely and circulate it as much as possible in the hopes that perhaps\nthe forces of evil will be thwarted. We can only hope that this might inspire the powers\nthat be to commercially release the entire show. Snippets of the Larks\\&amp;#039; Tongues I\nfrom this show were used for the 1973 television promo for the album\\&amp;#039;s initial realease,\nso one could assume (albeit a fantasy) that the entire set was filmed and is in the\ncan somewhere.
