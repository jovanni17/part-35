This is a COMPLETE h.264 MKV rip of the entire 11-DVD series, including all DVD extras. The set comes with no subtitles or closed captioning. The overall file size is smaller and the quality is higher than the existing DivX torrent. All files were passed through high quality setting on HandBrake.\n\nThe World at War (1973Ã¢â‚¬â€œ74) is a 26-episode British television documentary series chronicling the events of the Second World War. At the time of its completion in 1973 it was the most expensive series ever made, costing Ã‚Â£900,000. It was produced by Jeremy Isaacs, narrated by Laurence Olivier and has a score composed by Carl Davis. A book, The World at War, was written by Mark Arnold-Forster to accompany it.\n\nSince production was completed, The World at War has attracted acclaim and is now regarded as a landmark in British television history.[2] Following the time of its completion, and as the Second World War remained fresh in many people's minds, the producer Jeremy Isaacs was considered ahead of his time in resurrecting studies of military history.[3] The series focused on, among other things, portrayal of the devastating human experiences of the conflict; how life and death throughout the war years affected soldiers, sailors and airmen, civilians, the tragic victims of tyranny and concentration camp inmates.\n\nThe World at War, which made use of rare colour film footage, was commissioned by Thames Television in 1969. Such was the extent of its research, it took four years to produce at a cost of Ã‚Â£900,000 (2009 equivalent: Ã‚Â£11.4 million[4]). At the time, this was a record for a British television series. It was first shown in 1973, on ITV.\n\nThe series interviewed major members of the Allied and Axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them Albert Speer, Karl DÃƒÂ¶nitz, Walter Warlimont, James Stewart, Bill Mauldin, W. Averell Harriman, Curtis LeMay, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, Alger Hiss, Toshikazu Kase, Mitsuo Fuchida, Minoru Genda, J. B. Priestley, Brian Horrocks, John J. McCloy, Lawrence Durrell, Arthur Harris, Charles Sweeney, Paul Tibbets, Anthony Eden, Traudl Junge, Mark Clark, Adolf Galland, Hasso von Manteuffel, and historian Stephen Ambrose.\n\nIn the programme The Making of &quot;The World at War&quot;, included in the DVD set, Jeremy Isaacs explains that priority was given to interviews with surviving aides and assistants rather than recognised figures. The most difficult person to locate and persuade to be interviewed was Heinrich Himmler's adjutant, Karl Wolff. During the interview, he admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in Himmler's presence. Isaacs later expressed satisfaction with the content of the series, noting that if it had been unclassified knowledge at the time of production, he would have added references to British codebreaking efforts.\n\nIn a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute during 2000, voted for by industry professionals, The World at War ranked 19th.\n\n\n01 - A New Germany (1933Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1939)\n02 - A Distant War (September 1939 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ May 1940)\n03 - France Falls (May Ã¢â‚¬â€œ June 1940)\n04 - Alone (May 1940 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ May 1941)\n05 - Barbarossa (June Ã¢â‚¬â€œ December 1941)\n06 - Banzai!
