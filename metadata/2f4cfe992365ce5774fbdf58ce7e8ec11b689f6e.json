Napolitano, &quot;It Is Dangerous to Be Right When the Government Is Wrong: The Case for Personal Freedom\n\n\nAndrew P. Napolitano, &quot;It Is Dangerous to Be Right When the Government Is Wrong: The Case for Personal Freedom&quot; \nTh.mas N.lson | 2011 | ISBN: 1595553509 | 320 pages | epub, mobi | 0,8 + 1 MB \n\nJudge Andrew P. Napolitano examines the concept the government hates and fears the most: Freedom.\n \nThe United States of America was born out of a bloody revolt against tyranny. Yet almost from its inception, the government here has suppressed liberty. In his sixth book on the Constitution and human freedom, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano asks: Where does freedom come from? How can government in America exercise power that the people have not given to it? What forces have collaborated to destroy personal freedom?\n \nIn this back-to-basics on freedom, Judge Napolitano addresses hard questions: \nDo we still have a Constitution?\n What are the limits to government power in a free society?\n Why does the government attack, rather than defend, our rights?\n If our rights are inalienable, how can the government take them away?\n Do we really own any private property?\n \nThe Judge gives a sweeping treatment of natural rights and all the philosophical, religious, and ideological principles that underscore the concept of human freedom. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f4cfe992365ce5774fbdf58ce7e8ec11b689f6e","amp;dn":"It+Is+Dangerous+to+Be+Right+When+the+Government+Is+Wrong-.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f4cfe992365ce5774fbdf58ce7e8ec11b689f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,76,254,153,35,101,206,87,116,251,223,88,206,126,142,193,27,104,159,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
