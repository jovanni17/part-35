Ludicrous in scope, whimsical in its arrangement, this wildly entertaining tome presents pithy and provocative biographies of the no-longer-living from the famous to the undeservedly andÃ¢â‚¬â€until nowÃ¢â‚¬â€permanently obscure. Spades in hand, Lloyd and Mitchinson have dug up everything embarrassing, fascinating, and downright weird about their subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives and added their own uniquely irreverent observations.\nOrganized by capricious categoriesÃ¢â‚¬â€such as dead people who died virgins, who kept pet monkeys, who lost limbs, whose corpses refused to stay putÃ¢â‚¬â€the dearly departed, from the inventor of the stove to a cross-dressing, bear-baiting female gangster finally receive the epitaphs they truly deserve.\nDiscover:\n* Why Freud had a lifelong fear of trains\n* The one thing that really made Isaac Newton laugh\n* How Catherine the Great really died (no horse was involved)\nMuch like the country doctor who cured smallpox (heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in here), Lloyd and Mitchinson have the perfect antidote for anyone out there dying of boredom. The Book of the DeadÃ¢â‚¬â€like life itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€is hilarious, tragic, bizarre, and amazing. You may never pass a graveyard again without chuckling.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4835efe9ac4b923c67cd5143ccf40fceafaa5c7f","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+the+Dead+-+John+Lloyd+%282010+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4835efe9ac4b923c67cd5143ccf40fceafaa5c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,53,239,233,172,75,146,60,103,205,81,67,204,244,15,206,175,170,92,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
