Belushi and Aykroyd, respectively in character as lead vocalist &quot;Joliet Jake&quot; Blues and harmonica player/backing vocalist Elwood Blues, fronted the band, which was composed of well-known and respected musicians. The band made its debut as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live.\nThe band began to take on a life beyond the confines of the television screen, releasing an album, Briefcase Full of Blues, in 1978, and then having a Hollywood film, The Blues Brothers, created around its characters in 1980.\nAfter the death of Belushi in 1982, the Blues Brothers have continued to perform with a rotation of guest singers and other band members. The band reformed in 1988 for a world tour and again in 1998 for a sequel to the film, Blues Brothers 2000. They make regular appearances at musical festivals worldwide.\nOn August 31, 2011, it was announced that Dan Aykroyd and Judith Belushi Pisano were pitching a new Blues Brothers TV series to primetime networks.[1][2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00cf2f00d0ad308cbed5fad4d05df1f4e3ca3b3c","amp;dn":"Blues+Brothers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00cf2f00d0ad308cbed5fad4d05df1f4e3ca3b3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,207,47,0,208,173,48,140,190,213,250,212,208,93,241,244,227,202,59,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
