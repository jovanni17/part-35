Adapted from John Irving&amp;#039;s best-selling novel A Widow for One Year, the film is set in the privileged beach community of East Hampton, New York and chronicles one pivotal summer in the lives of famous children&amp;#039;s book author Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges) and his beautiful wife Marion (Kim Basinger). Their once-great marriage has been strained by tragedy. Her resulting despondency and his subsequent infidelities have prevented the couple from confronting a much-needed change in their relationship. Eddie O&amp;#039;Hare, the young man Ted hires to work as his summer assistant, is the couple&amp;#039;s unwitting yet willing pawn - and, ultimately, the catalyst in the transformation of their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3663b5893e5761129deae2f0dee1e99f6b7b2cb0","amp;dn":"The+Door+in+the+Floor+%282004%29+Xvid.+%5BDVD-rip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3663b5893e5761129deae2f0dee1e99f6b7b2cb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,99,181,137,62,87,97,18,157,234,226,240,222,225,233,159,107,123,44,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
