RCA's Living Stereo recording was instantly hailed as one of the best-sounding concert recordings of the era and remains highly collectable among audiophiles. Many of Belafonte's hits are here, but it's far more than a singer doing his best-known numbers for adoring fans. It was a coming together of artist, music and audience that would not be rivaled until Judy Garland took the stage at Carnegie Hall some years later. This is a digital version of RCA's Living Stereo 4-track double-play tape version of the two-disc album. No splices. No ticks. No pops. Just great music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ca725d389f72a58e3d2ee6d4b6187b07da5f0e","amp;dn":"Belafonte+at+Carnegie+Hall+%281959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ca725d389f72a58e3d2ee6d4b6187b07da5f0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,202,114,93,56,159,114,165,142,61,46,230,212,182,24,123,7,218,95,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
