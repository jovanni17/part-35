Zimmerman provides textual interpretation, commentary, and two translations along with samples of the original text.\n\nFor more information, you can read the Wikipedia overview here:\nTathÃ„ï¿½gatagarbha SÃ…Â«tra\n\nThis is the original PDF copy and it is highly readable, if a little large. The text is scanned but it appears to be from a digital master source and thus does not have any awkward formatting issues. The front cover is also included (which is just the manuscript cover page).
