Naturally, it leads to the conviction\nthat the degrees of freedom are isolated. To explain the gyroscopic phenomenon,\ndemonstrating connected in a system degrees of freedom Mechanics has been compelled to\ndevelop models like the one of vector multiplication. This paper suggests an explanation of\nthe phenomenon from the point of view of the inertial effect of changed direction. Then the\npaper juxtaposes the new solution to the well-established one. The new solution extends the\nfrontiers. We find that it corresponds to the spin of elementary particles, more specifically to\nthe spin of electron.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0ab5b0803268f16fed8ca21e6e73e9507b51066","amp;dn":"Bojidar+Djordjev+The+impact+of+the+Laws+of+the+Nonlinear+Dynamic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0ab5b0803268f16fed8ca21e6e73e9507b51066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,171,91,8,3,38,143,22,254,216,202,33,230,231,62,149,7,181,16,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
