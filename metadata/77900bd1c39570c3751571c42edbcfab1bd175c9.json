Both are pernicious processes that impair the durability of the infrastructure assets, the industry efficiency and profitability and the quality of the environment. Therefore, it is essential to develop and to apply corrosion engineering control methods and techniques, in particular those being environment-friendly. In this crucial time of worldwide energy crisis and economic turmoil, cost effective corrosion control will extend the life of the infrastructure saving large expenses in materials, equipment and structures. This book will contribute to achieve this important mission!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77900bd1c39570c3751571c42edbcfab1bd175c9","amp;dn":"Environmental+and+Industrial+Corrosion+-+Practical+and+Theoretic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77900bd1c39570c3751571c42edbcfab1bd175c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,144,11,209,195,149,112,195,117,21,113,196,46,219,207,171,27,209,117,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
