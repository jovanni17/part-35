I have always found him to be annoying, but in this film he was likeable and quite clever. &quot;Stevo&quot; is the blue-haired punk son of silly, over-hippified parents who went from mohawk to a more low-key look after graduation. He is obviously not stupid. He uses his audience-addressing monologues to amuse us and let us know exactly what's up, instead of merely whining at us or grinning and nudging us with his elbow. The kid is downright charming. And I appreciate the fact that he actually gets along with his parents, even while fighting against what they want. It's refreshing. I am in his age group (in the movie - 80's teenager) but I am not familiar with punk lifestyle, and now I feel like I have been exposed to something I've always found interesting, but never delved into before. Stevo goes through a bunch of changes and realizations, and by the end decides that you can &quot;F--k stuff up more from within the system that outside it&quot;. And that being rebellious comes from inside, and not from your haircolor (even though blue hair is still cool). Great message, neat movie.
