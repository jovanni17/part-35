A singer/songwriter lauded by his peers and\ncited by such publications as the NME as sufficiently important as to being\nrequired to be taught in schools. However the NME heyday as as important\nindicators of talent and importance are long gone; it now being staffed by\nstringers and a passionless ner do wells. We shall see for ourselves The album\nis in chronological order and takes the listener on a trip that illustrates\nBruntnellÃƒâ€ s development as a songwriter as well as an arranger and performer.\nThe early stuff from ÃƒÂ¦CannibalÃƒâ€  and ÃƒÂ¦Camelot and SmithereensÃƒâ€  is hard to date\nand hard to classify although the cracked vocal is mixed low but still to the\nfore. The arrangement on ÃƒÂ¦25 ReasonsÃƒâ€  owes much to Jack NietzcheÃƒâ€ s work for the\nBuffalo Springfield with its dreamy and somnambulant quality. The seeds had\nbeen\nsown.\n\nThe Rykodisc contributions from ÃƒÂ¦Normal for BridgewaterÃƒâ€  move Bruntnell\nforward,\npositing the theory that although a songwriter he is also a singer and band\nleader carving out big sounds fit for arenas. ÃƒÂ¦Shot from a SpringÃƒâ€  has all the\npedigree of a show stopper and indeed when performed with a full band can bring\nthe house down as the guitars drift and yearn through the melodies. The Loose\nyears begin with BruntnellÃƒâ€ s very own ÃƒÂ¦PowderfingerÃƒâ€  - ÃƒÂ¦Here Come the SwellsÃƒâ€  a\nswaggering slice of American rock anglicised by the understated vocal delivery\nyet still a towering, melancholy masterpiece with its cushion of guitars and\npunchy harmonies. These are all deeply commercial songs that hold onto their\nhonesty and truth through careful production and a great sense artistry. The\njoy\nto be had listening to the Bruntnell/ James WalbourneÃƒâ€ s acoustic duet of ÃƒÂ¦By\nThe\nTime My Head Gets To PhoenixÃƒâ€  does not diminish - two guys , guitars, great\nsong\nand sumptuous vocals. WhatÃƒâ€ s not to like?? By the time we reach the tracks from\nthe album Ghost in a Spitfire there is a sense of both artist and label\nreaching\nfor the commercial breakthrough. These are massive songs and designed to be\nheard by the masses. Then frustration or restlessness leads to a left turn\nwhich\nproduces the wonderful and shapeshifting songs from ÃƒÂ¦Peter and a Murder of\nCrowsÃƒâ€  - ÃƒÂ¦Cold Water SwimmerÃƒâ€  and ÃƒÂ¦DomesticoÃƒâ€  . The songs have a playfulness\nand\nheft that exists within the swirling drones and Traffic like pastoralism. Still\nthe cracked clear vocals and excellent production but a road less travelled,\nthe\nharmonium, the cellos and the hushed drums belying the beauty and bathos.\nStunning stuff. ÃƒÂ¦Black Mountain UFOÃƒâ€  provides the penultimate tracks - breezy\nAmericana with a hint of English psychedelia although ÃƒÂ¦Ghost DogÃƒâ€  owes as much\nto YoungÃƒâ€ s ÃƒÂ¦Southern ManÃƒâ€ . We finish with the bid for a hit - an old track\nÃƒÂ¦Played OutÃƒâ€  with added Rumer. ItÃƒâ€ s wonderful and her vocal fits like a glove .\nUnnecessary but a great collaboration and this reviewer for one hope it does\nthe\ntrick. And what would that trick be? Sufficient commercial success to enable\nBruntnell to continue writing and performing without worrying about the next\nquid so he can add to his exquisite back catalogue or massive public acceptance\nleading to untold wealth and stadium tours and celebrity tie ins? I hope the\nformer but if heÃƒâ€ s after the latter then he deserves that too. This is is a\nnear\nperfect album spoilt only by a lack of certain other songs and its title. It\nshould have been called be ÃƒÂ¦An introductionÃƒâ€  or ÃƒÂ¦ The songs you should know by\nnowÃƒâ€  but what do I know.
