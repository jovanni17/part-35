There is no upgrade option available,\nbecause the option is removed.

In the second\ntwo options where IE/OE/MSN/WMP are removed, Mozilla Firefox v2.0.0.1\nis included to replace Internet Explorer. There are no replacements to the\nother programs (OE/MSN/WMP) but you can just use your own programs\nlike Mozilla Thunderbird, Trillian, Winamp and so on.\n\n[Automatic Driver Installation]\nOptions one and three both include drivers to cover the following:\nChipset, CPU, Ethernet LAN Cards, Graphics (ATI and NVIDIA),\nSATA (Mass Storage), Sound Cards and Wireless Ethernet.\n\n[No Drivers Included]\nOptions two and four do not contain those drivers - this is in case\nyou have SATA problems with the first or third options, or if you\njust want to install your own drivers.\n\n[Acronis Backup + Restore]\nOption five allows you to backup your existing partition(s) before\ninstalling Windows, or you can quickly restore a backup made\npreviously with Acronis.\n\n[Hirens Boot CD v8.8]\nOption six allows you to boot into Hirens Boot CD version 8.8.

If you say no to all the questions,\nit is possible to have Windows TinyXP running on just four services, eleven\nprocesses and using only 34.7Mb RAM - this would be an extremely reduced\nfunctionality configuration but depending on your system you might be able\nto run Windows on just four services! Most programs will still work but if you\nsay no to all questions it might affect internet connectivity - make sure to read\nthe questions... all you would have to do to get all your functionality back is\nrun the \\&quot;Save System RAM Memory\\&quot; and simply answer yes to each question.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemoved Items:\n\nThe following items have been removed from options one and two...\n\n[APPLICATIONS]\nAccessibility Options\nBriefcase\nGames\nInternet Games\nNT Backup\nPinball\nScreensavers\n\n[DRIVERS]\nDisplay Adapters\nISDN\nModems\nPrinters\nScanners\n\n[LANGUAGES]\nArabic (Algeria), Arabic (Bahrain), Arabic (Egypt), Arabic (Iraq),\nArabic (Jordan), Arabic (Kuwait), Arabic (Lebanon), Arabic (Libya),\nArabic (Morocco), Arabic (Oman), Arabic (Qatar), Arabic (Saudi Arabia),\nArabic (Syria), Arabic (Tunisia), Arabic (U.A.E.), Arabic (Yemen), Divehi\n(Maldives), Syriac (Syria), Urdu, Armenian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian,\nAzeri (Cyrillic), Belarusian, FYRO Macedonian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz (Kyrgyzstan),\nMongolian (Mongolia), Tatar, Ukrainian, Uzbek (Cyrillic), Georgian, Greek,\nHebrew, Bengali (India), Gujarati (India), Hindi, Kannada (India), Konkani,\nMalayalam (India), Marathi, Punjabi (India), Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu (India),\nJapanese, Korean, Chinese (PRC), Chinese (Singapore), Farsi, Thai, Chinese\n(Hong Kong S.A.R.), Chinese (Macau S.A.R.), Chinese (Taiwan), Azeri (Latin),\nTurkish, Uzbek (Latin), Vietnamese.\n\n[MULTIMEDIA]\nImages and Backgrounds\nMovie Maker\nMusic Samples\nWindows Sounds\n\n[NETWORK]\nClient for Netware Networks\nCommunication tools\nFrontPage Extensions\nInternet Connection Wizard\nInternet Information Services (IIS)\nIP Conferencing\nMSN Explorer\nNetmeeting\nNetShell Cmd-Tool\nNWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Protocol\nPeer-to-Peer\nSynchronization Manager\nTAPI Application Support\nWeb Folders\nWindows Messenger\n\n[OPERATING SYSTEM OPTIONS]\n.NET Framework\nAdministrative Templates\nBlaster/Nachi removal tool\nColor Schemes\nDisk and Profile Quota\nDR Watson\nExtensible Storage Engine (Esent97)\nExtra Fonts\nFile and Settings Wizard\nHelp and Support\nManual Install and Upgrade\nMS Agent\nOut of Box Experience (OOBE)\nRemote Installation Services (RIS)\nSearch Assistant\nSecurity Center\nService Pack Messages\nTour\n\n[SERVICES]\nAlerter\nBeep Driver\nDistributed Link Tracking Client\nDistributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC)\nError Reporting\nIMAPI CD-Burning COM Service\nIndexing Service\nIPSEC Policy Agent\nMessage Queuing (MSMQ)\nMessenger\nNetwork DDE\nQoS RSVP\nQuality of Service (QoS)\nRemote Registry\nRemovable Storage\nService Advertising Protocol\nSystem Restore Service\nTelnet\nText Services Framework\nWindows Time\n\n[DIRECTORIES]\nDOCS\nSUPPORT\nVALUEADD\n\nFor the options with Internet Explorer, Outlook Express, MSN\nMessenger and Windows Media Player (Options one and two)\nthe WINDOWS folder takes up about 570Mb of hard disk space.\n\nFor the options without Internet Explorer, Outlook Express,\nMSN Messenger or Windows Media Player (Options three\nand four) the WINDOWS folder takes up about 435Mb of\nhard disk space.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbca84add46dadb30530103929f51275234bfd8b","amp;dn":"TinyXP_rev06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbca84add46dadb30530103929f51275234bfd8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,202,132,173,212,109,173,179,5,48,16,57,41,245,18,117,35,75,253,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
