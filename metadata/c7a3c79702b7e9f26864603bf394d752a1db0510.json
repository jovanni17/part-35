In the last few years of his life he churned out loads of shockers, including 'Snuff Trap' (which I really enjoyed) and that one that's a cross between Predator and Cannibal Holocaust...aye, 'Land Of Death', that's the one...\n\nThis one here, though, is an absolute cracker and easily as 'good' as his 80s classic, 'Hell Of The Living Dead'/'Zombie Creeping Flesh'. It takes half an hour or so before it kicks off, but when it does, you will be incredulous that a film like this could still be made in 2007. Dialogue and dubbing are reliably hilarious, there's shedloads of gore and some very nasty and distasteful set-pieces. Plot is vague and gets mighty confused at the end, but you'd expect nothing less really. Cinematography looks nice and whilst I'm pretty sure this is SOV, it looks a lot better than 'Land Of Death' (which looked really CHEAP, but not in a good way). \n\nThis movie gives you hope that this sort of thing can still be done - rip-roaring, action- packed brainless un-PC horror with not a shred of irony or post-modernism to be seen.
