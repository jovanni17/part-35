Agreeing to make weapons for the terrorists, \nhe was saved by fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen who installed a magnetic chest plate to \nkeep him alive and helped him realize the deaths his weapons manufacturing has caused. \nThis led to the creation of the mini arc-reactor and, subsequently, Iron Man,\nbut Yinsen sacrificed himself to give Tony a chance to escape. Meanwhile in the present, \na race driver named Kawashima, who had broken his legs and desires to drive again, \nis given cybernetic enhancements on the condition that he kills Tony. When Tony is targeted, \nhe is saved by the sudden appearance of Logan, who is in Japan investigating A.I.M. \nIron Man later fights against Kawashima, who controls the Zodiac warrior Taurus but is soon \ntaken over by it. With the help of Logan, Iron Man defeats Taurus and rescues Kawashima, \nbut soon comes face to face with Dio and is shocked to find what appears to be Yinsen inside.  \n\n[b]Spoken Language: English[/b]\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nInfo\n=====\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 176M\nPlayTime           : 00:23:02.449\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 41432\nVideoBitRate       : 928509\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat: Avi\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nScreens\n========\n\n[URL=http://img810.imageshack.us/i/ironman104atwistinmemor.jpg/][IMG]http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/6443/ironman104atwistinmemor.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nHash\n====\nE1935D7E8904489E99D820D8F2465DE71F670F29\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1935d7e8904489e99d820d8f2465de71f670f29","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+-+104+-+A+Twist+in+Memory%2Ca+Turn+of+Mind+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1935d7e8904489e99d820d8f2465de71f670f29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,147,93,126,137,4,72,158,153,216,32,216,242,70,93,231,31,103,15,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
