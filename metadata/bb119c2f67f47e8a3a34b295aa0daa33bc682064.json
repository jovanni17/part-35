Martha won Best New Act at the BBC Folk Awards back in 2007 and judging by the quality of the songs on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Lucy and the WolvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ that is hardly surprising. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a pure quality not only to her songs but to her voice which is a thing of rare beauty. \n\nBut apart from that voice which really is exceptional, I should mention MarthaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s backing band, the Woods, who are really outstanding. Jon Thorne shines with his double bass and the songs are embellished with bouzouki, mandolin, cello and violin to name just a few of the instruments which add so much texture to these songs. \n\nAlthough maybe not so similar vocally IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m constantly reminded of Charlotte GreigÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Winter WoodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ album while listening to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Lucy and the WolvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Both albums have that pastoral, autumnal fell to them. Both artists create a real earthy, woody sound although as much as Charlotte Greig is a great singer Martha has the edge over her vocally. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s such a pure quality to MarthaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals which is quite rare these days. \nThere are some nice unexpected touches, the crackling of an open fire which starts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Who TurnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ nicely sums up the feeling of not only that song but the album as a whole. Again with just acoustic guitar, this time courtesy Matt Kelly and the ever-present double bass the focus is on MarthaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals once more and, while they are faultless on every song on the album, the vocals on this particular track will send shivers up your spine. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Lucy and the WolvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ will obviously not appeal to those who are not fans of folk music, Martha rarely ventures into other territories, on this album at least, and why should she when she is so good and obviously a natural in this genre but it will be lapped up by those who like their folk music to be the real thing. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Lucy and the WolvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is an atmospheric collection of songs, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a very English-sounding album and you can almost feel the amount of love and care that has so obviously gone into making each song so special. Martha Tilston and her band have created what will, in years to come, be looked back upon as a classic in the folk music world. But donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wait until the major music magazines rediscover it in five years time; do yourself a favour and listen to it now. \n\n 1. the cape,\n 2. rockpools,\n 3. lucy, \n 4. who turns, \n 5. wild swimming,\n 6. 350 bells, \n 7. my chair, \n 8. seabirds,\n 9. searching for lambs, \n10. old tom cat, \n11. wave machine,\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb119c2f67f47e8a3a34b295aa0daa33bc682064","amp;dn":"Martha+Tilston...Lucy+%26+the+Wolves%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb119c2f67f47e8a3a34b295aa0daa33bc682064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,17,156,47,103,244,126,138,58,52,178,149,170,13,170,51,188,104,32,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
