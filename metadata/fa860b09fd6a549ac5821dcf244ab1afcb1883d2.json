Capt. James Embry commanded the aircraft but has no memory of how he got there. More importantly to him, his crew is nowhere to be found. At one point, he even begins to wonder if he is hallucinating, especially after he sees one of his men momentarily sitting in the cockpit. When he awakens in a hospital bed he thinks it was all a dream but then wonders: did he really go back to the desert.\n\n\nThis one was always a bit spooky to me.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa860b09fd6a549ac5821dcf244ab1afcb1883d2","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+King+Nine+Will+Not+Return","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa860b09fd6a549ac5821dcf244ab1afcb1883d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,134,11,9,253,106,84,154,197,130,29,207,36,74,177,175,203,24,131,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
