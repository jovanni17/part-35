It was the first album by Browne where overtly political and socially critical songs dominated, although it also included one of his best remembered songs about relationships, the tragic &quot;In the Shape of a Heart&quot;, inspired by his relationship with his first wife. Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album #88 on its list of the best 100 albums of the 1980s. Among Browne's fans, the album can be somewhat divisive. While many feel it is inferior to his 1970's output, others hail it as one of his strongest albums. The radio play garnered by &quot;For America&quot; and &quot;In the Shape of a Heart&quot;, and the use of &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot; in the show Miami Vice, gained him many new fans who later went back and discovered Browne's earlier works.\n\nClyde Jackson Browne (born October 9, 1948) is an American rock singer-songwriter and musician. His introspective lyrics made him the poster boy of the Southern California confessional singer-songwriter movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 2004, Browne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by fellow American musical artist and good friend, Bruce Springsteen. In the same year, Browne received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Los Angeles' Occidental College for &quot;a remarkable musical career that has successfully combined an intensely personal artistry with a broader vision of social change and justice&quot;.\n\nPolitical protest came to the fore in Browne's music in the 1986 album, Lives in the Balance, an explicit condemnation of Reaganism and U.S. policy in Central America. Flavored with new instrumental textures, it was a huge success with Browne fans, though not with mainstream audiences. The title track, &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot;, with its Andean pan pipes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and lines like, &quot;There's a shadow on the faces / Of the men who fan the flames / Of the wars that are fought in places / Where we can't even say the names&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was an outcry against U.S.-backed wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The song was used at several points in the award-winning 1987 PBS documentary, The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis, by journalist Bill Moyers, and was part of the soundtrack of Stone's War, a 1986 Miami Vice episode focusing on American involvement in Central America.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:165df4a7710843f2e866fc37f70411786dc713ab","amp;dn":"Jackson+Browne+-+Lives+In+The+Balance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"165df4a7710843f2e866fc37f70411786dc713ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,93,244,167,113,8,67,242,232,102,252,55,247,4,17,120,109,199,19,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
