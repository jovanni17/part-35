In it she heads in a third musical direction, that of pop music. Griffith, whose background is primarily folk music, turned toward country music in her preceding four or five albums, and here, again, ventures into a little different style. Griffith enlisted the talents of noted rock music producer Glyn Johns for the musical style change. The album landed at #42 on the Billboard Country Albums chart, and at #99 on the Pop Albums chart in 1989.\n\nAll tracks composed by Nanci Griffith; except where indicated\n\n&quot;I Don't Wanna Talk About Love&quot; (Griffith, James Hooker) - 4:08 \n&quot;Drive-In Movies and Dashboard Lights&quot; - 3:14 \n&quot;You Made This Love a Teardrop&quot; - 3:12 \n&quot;Brave Companion of the Road&quot; - 3:20 \n&quot;Storms&quot; (Eric Taylor) - 3:10 \n&quot;It's a Hard Life Wherever You Go&quot; - 4:01 \n&quot;If Wishes Were Changes&quot; (Griffith, James Hooker) - 3:47 \n&quot;Listen to the Radio&quot; - 3:48 \n&quot;Leaving the Harbor&quot; - 3:28 \n&quot;Radio Fragile&quot; (Griffith, James Hooker) - 5:36\n\nripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b747fd6c7112b9cb9abbab2c94e7165f81f5d9","amp;dn":"Nanci+Griffith...Storms%281989%29cdrip%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b747fd6c7112b9cb9abbab2c94e7165f81f5d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,183,71,253,108,113,18,185,203,154,187,171,44,148,231,22,95,129,245,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
