This collection spans his thirty-five-year career, and it doesn&amp;#039;t leave out much. Originally a Canadian poet and country-music fan, Cohen moved to New York in the late Sixties and became a folk singer. Now a Buddhist, Cohen has always been concerned with the sanctity of real life and the dangers of real love. The startling &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; from 1984, is a majestic example of the former, and there are too many examples of the latter to count, from the darkly sly &quot;I&amp;#039;m Your Man&quot; (1988) to the lost and forsaken &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; (1970). One could complain about the absence of various wonders, such as his early, way-bleak &quot;The Butcher,&quot; or object to the inclusion of four songs from Cohen&amp;#039;s most recent album, but that would be quibbling. These are literate songs that require time, careful attention and the sort of contemplation we normally reserve for life lessons.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n1. Suzanne\n2. Stranger Song, The\n3.
