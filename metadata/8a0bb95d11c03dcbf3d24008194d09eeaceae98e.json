Now, Zahi decides to go on his final journey to      \n         the Five Chambers with the fellows in tow...together they     \n         will document the ancient graffiti on the walls of the        \n         Chambers, proving Zahi's theory that ancient Egyptians,       \n         not slaves, built the Pyramids at Giza. This near-death       \n         experience leaves the fellows; Leslie, the executive          \n         producer; and, the crew gasping for air. Finally, Zahi will   \n          reveal his findings in an exclusive television interview.     \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
