And indeed, it is a fusion of the more tradional Cajun style and the more African-American, rhythm &amp; blues-oriented zydeco sound. The band uses a Hammond B3 organ in addition to the accordion (like Buckwheat Zydeco and the Ils Sont Partis band.) The songs are mostly sung in English, with a smattering of French to keep the disc authentic. But Wayne Toups is definitely reaching out to a broader audience than most zydeco or Cajun artists. Toups attempts a couple of covers--a version of &quot;Tell It Like It Is,&quot; and Van Morrison's &quot;Tupelo Honey.&quot; He gives these a new spin, and they are quite successful versions. A fun &quot;Johnny Ne Peut Pas Danser&quot;--or, more familiarly, &quot;Johnny Can't Dance,&quot; written by Wayne Toups and Michael Doucet, gives an example of this band's unique sound.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc23c3b5bcd0c43b4f70a573242b58e1cf459cb","amp;dn":"Wayne+Toups+%26amp%3B+Zydecajun+-+Blast+From+The+Bayou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc23c3b5bcd0c43b4f70a573242b58e1cf459cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,194,60,59,91,205,12,67,180,247,10,87,50,66,181,142,28,244,89,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
