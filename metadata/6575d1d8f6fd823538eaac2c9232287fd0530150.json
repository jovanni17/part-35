In 2010, Juan Carlos relinquished his position with The Quakes to focus on the Limit Club. Work on the upcoming album proceeded slowly, and Cutthroat Business wasn't fully recorded, mixed and released until March 2011. The extra time was not in waste, for this proved to be the most professional album yet. They filmed their first music video in June 2011 for the single, Shake from utthroat Business (directed by Elijah Bustos, UCB Productions).The band hooked up with friends The Henchmen and organized a full US tour in the summer of 2011. A success, the band gained wide exposure among fresh music scenes nationwide. In October 2011, the band officially added Monty O'Blivion to their lineup, on auxiliary guitar and backing vocals.\n\nThe gentlemen from PhoenixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Limit Club want you to swing through the apocalypse. If you happen to have their 2011 release, This is Cutthroat Business, on hand at the end of the world, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll probably want to follow their advice. The twelve tracks on the new album will have you swinging, shaking, rocking, rolling, and reeling into a psychobilly frenzy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6575d1d8f6fd823538eaac2c9232287fd0530150","amp;dn":"The+Limit+Club+-+This+is+Cutthroat+Business+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6575d1d8f6fd823538eaac2c9232287fd0530150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,117,209,216,246,253,130,53,56,234,172,44,146,50,40,127,208,83,1,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
