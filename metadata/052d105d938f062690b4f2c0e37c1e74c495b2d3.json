The intensity can change dramatically in one and\nthe same piece, evolving from high energy towards calm moments, yet it is the\nopen nature of the pieces that is its strongest characteristic. Sorey's &quot;Slow\nBurn&quot; is indeed slow, with the least number of notes necessary to create a\ngreat atmosphere full of tension. The tones are stretched, and remain open,\nwaiting for silence to evaporate them or to be replaced with new ones, quietly,\nslowly. On &quot;Canines&quot;, the open nature remains, with silence dominating,\nfractured by some bluesy chords and incredibly sensitive blowing by Laubrock,\npossibly one of her biggest strengths, yet slowly a theme emerges, the tempo\nincreases, and the piece gets some harmonic development, like a story being\ntold. A musical story. The whole album is like this, with linear story-telling,\ncareful attention to detail and overall effect, without falling back on easy\npatterns.\n\nThe biggest effect comes from the slow tension-building silences that define\nthe overall sound : there is no hurry, the pace is measured, each note ripens\nfully and almost individually. The density of the album shifts repeatedly, but\nregardless of the moment, it is always very lyrical and with three musicians\nworking as one on the same concept. Really great.\n\nFor those interested in the album's title : the paradoxical frog is also called\nthe shrinking frog, because the tadpole can have three to four times the size\nof the adult animal.\n\n--\n\nby Chris May &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=36985&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=36985&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD30/PoD30MoreMoments3.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD30/PoD30MoreMoments3.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor Sergio Piccirilli (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2010/09/05/kris-davis-ingrid-laubrock-tyshawn-sorey-paradoxical-frog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2010/09/05/kris-davis-ingrid-laubrock-tyshawn-sorey-paradoxical-frog/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:052d105d938f062690b4f2c0e37c1e74c495b2d3","amp;dn":"Kris+Davis%2C+Ingrid+Laubrock%2C+Tyshawn+Sorey+-+Paradoxical+Frog+%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"052d105d938f062690b4f2c0e37c1e74c495b2d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,45,16,93,147,143,6,38,144,180,242,192,227,124,30,116,196,149,178,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
