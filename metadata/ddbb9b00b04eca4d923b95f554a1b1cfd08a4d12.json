Act 2\n\nhe annual mini festivals at the Barbican are a wonderful opportunity to get an in-depth experience of a composer. This year it was the American John Adams turn. The weekend started off with AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ controversial opera The Death of Klinghoffer (1990), unfortunately only in a concert performance. It is a great piece with a poignant political edge. The London audience, in the packed Barbican Hall, loved the piece. Alice Goodman, the librettist, managed to sustain ambiguity, taking side neither for the Palestinians nor the Israelis. Adams and Goodman were able to show the suffering and emotions of both parties of the eternal conflict. This is great art! \n\n The Death of Klinghoffer is a complex, ambiguous piece which touches current sensibilities and is thought provoking. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=560&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=560&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddbb9b00b04eca4d923b95f554a1b1cfd08a4d12","amp;dn":"John+Adams+-+Death+of+Klinghoffer+-+London+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddbb9b00b04eca4d923b95f554a1b1cfd08a4d12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,187,155,0,176,78,202,77,146,59,149,245,84,161,177,207,208,138,77,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
