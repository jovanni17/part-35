Finally did after a lot\nof searching. I'm not going to name the source, as to not call WOTC's\nattention to them.\n\nIn one folder is the original stuff, it has in there a very old\nversion of PCGen. Work with me here... the stuff from CMP is old. Very\nold. There are legal reasons why this is, I'm not going to go into\nthem. You're likely good with computers to throw this stuff together,\njust accept the struggle for a while, and only use Java 6, not 7.\n\nThe other folder is my installation. It has all of CMP's stuff \ninstalled already, with the added bonus of everything eslse being in\nthere and working (basically CMP recommended a way of doing something,\nI didn't understand their reasoning and did it my way which worked).\n\nGood luck. I'm putting this up because I noticed no one else offered\nthem, and others that did had broken delievery systems. I hope that\nit will make the ease of getting these matterals better.\n\nKyrillos27","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54e5b49360af4b2bddc3d0930ba3cce8e6cb2daa","amp;dn":"PCGen+with+CMP+Resources","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54e5b49360af4b2bddc3d0930ba3cce8e6cb2daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,229,180,147,96,175,75,43,221,195,208,147,11,163,204,232,230,203,45,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
