From the Koch Brothers to ExxonMobil*oil industry front groups to prominent politicians*this provocative expos+Ã‚Âª unravels the layers of deceit threatening democracy and the ability of future generations to survive on planet earth. \n----------------\n\nGreat documentary. Does a great job of exposing how greedy corporations and special interest groups have been bribing elected officials for years to continuously deny a clear scientific consensus, stalling any progress on the issue and placing our future in jeopardy in exchange for their personal gain. Even though this movie focuses solely on the issue of climate change, I believe it really shows just how much power outside groups have in our political system. I believe this film uncovers the cause of all of the bickering and stalling of progress in Washington that has been happening lately, regardless of the issue at hand. Everyone needs to see 'Greedy Lying Bastards'. After watching it, I felt absolutely outraged and I believe if others feel the same way I do, this film could be the beginning of a huge movement. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:271768f3d11a59b5428c9f6bb134aaaec28b3bc4","amp;dn":"Greedy+Lying+Bastards+-+Kochroaches%2C+et+al","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"271768f3d11a59b5428c9f6bb134aaaec28b3bc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,23,104,243,209,26,89,181,66,140,159,107,177,52,170,174,194,139,59,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
