Bowe Bergdahl, as the mystery behind how he fell into enemy hands widens. Jones also questions whether Obama committed an impeachable offense by refusing to consult Congress prior to authorizing the trade for five terrorist Guantanamo Bay detainees. \n\nOn today's show, Infowars reporters David Knight and Paul Joseph Watson give a run down of last week's Bilderberg 2014 conference, where elitist world leaders of all persuasions convened in secrecy to reach consensus on globalist affairs. \n\nIn the third hour, radio host and head of news at The People's Voice, Richie Allen, joins the program for an expanded discussion on Bilderberg, the European Union, how 9/11 and 7/7 served as his calls to action and the corporate ownership of media.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
