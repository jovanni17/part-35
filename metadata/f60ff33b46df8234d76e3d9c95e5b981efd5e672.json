Nothing has been changed, except the elimination of surface noise. Listen to the riffs as they were laid down here, before they were imitated into rock cliches. Was Green imitating the great Chicago bluesmen? Of course, but he listened more effectively than most. A raw, beautiful album that has engendered decades of debate as to how he got that tone from his instrument.\n\n\n1. Stop Messin' Around\n2. Jigsaw Puzzle Blues\n3. Doctor Brown\n4.
