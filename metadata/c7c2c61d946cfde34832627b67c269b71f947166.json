From the day that she was rescued from the path of an oncoming car by Conde Nast in New York and offered a job as a model on &quot;Vogue&quot;, Lee Miller's life was far from dull. Moving to Paris, where she became the lover and pupil of Man Ray, she met the man with whom she ultimately settled in Britain, Roland Penrose. Famed for her beauty, she established herself as an uncompromising photographer and war correspondent. Her post-war years are noted for her portraits of artists, many photographed while visiting her as friends at Farley Farm. Blending great art with original photography and intimate recollection, this book provides a first-hand account of a Surrealist artists' colony and the story of one of the most exciting artistic movements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7c2c61d946cfde34832627b67c269b71f947166","amp;dn":"The+Home+of+the+Surrealists+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7c2c61d946cfde34832627b67c269b71f947166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,194,198,29,148,108,253,227,72,50,98,123,103,194,105,183,31,148,113,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
