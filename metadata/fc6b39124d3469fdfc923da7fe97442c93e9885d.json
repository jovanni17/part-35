Britain's favourite Master Baker,\nPaul Hollywood, is on a mission to share his passion for baking bread\nin this new series. Over six weeks, he will reveal the secrets of breads\nfrom all over the world and with a feast of mouth-watering recipes,\nhe'll show how even the most humble loaf can be transformed into delicious\ndishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nIn this first programme, we celebrate the history and traditional\nflavours of great British bread. Paul explains the basics of bread\nmaking by making a classic white bloomer, a gorgeous crusty everyday\nbread that he transforms into the perfect portable lunch, and his\ncolourful roasted vegetable picnic loaf. We track the history of British\nbread making from farm to miller, brewer and baker and Paul bakes his\nultimate ploughman's loaf, a rye, oat and ale round. For tea, there is\nnothing better than a slice of Paul's honey glazed, fruit-packed\nmalt loaf. But his breads are no sideshow, so for a hearty family dinner\nhe bakes his medieval-style rye and wholemeal trencher, a stunning\ncentrepiece flat loaf piled high with watercress salad and sliced,\nseared lamb leg steaks in a mustard dressing.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/mFen9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/mFen9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/Fh9Vo.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/Fh9Vo.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/vTyEh.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/vTyEh.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPosted Image\nFormat MPEG-4\nFile Size 292 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate 1 324 Kbps\nDuration 28mn 48s\nSample No\nSubtitles No\n\nPosted Image\nContainer avc1\nVideo Codec Type x264\nVideo bitrate 1 200 Kbps / 1 200 Kbps\nResolution 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR) 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF) 0.167\nFrame Rate 25.000 fps\nSource me.lol\n\nPosted Image\nAudio Codec AAC\nBitrate Mode Variable\nBitrate 240 Kbps\nSample Rate 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count 2 channels [Front: L R]\nSpoken language English\n\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan)\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 19th of March 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc6b39124d3469fdfc923da7fe97442c93e9885d","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Paul+Hollywoods+Bread-Classic+Bread+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc6b39124d3469fdfc923da7fe97442c93e9885d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,107,57,18,77,52,105,253,252,146,61,167,254,151,68,44,147,233,136,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
