After he appeared on the nationally syndicated radio\nprogram Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz at the age of 12, he was already\ndisplaying formidable chops for one so young. After two earlier releases for the\nsmall D&amp;D label, he recorded his major label debut in early 2004 for Sony\nClassical. Already able to play at furious tempos normally associated with\ngreats like Oscar Peterson and the late Art Tatum, especially in the stunning\nopening rendition of &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown,&quot; he sometimes has trouble restraining\nhis ability to show off his technique, nearly overwhelming Bobby Timmons'\nsoulful &quot;Moanin'&quot; at times. Better are his reserved but refreshing approach to\n&quot;Nature Boy&quot; and the superb original ballad, &quot;Lady Wicks.&quot; Bassist John\nPatitucci and drummer Todd Strait provide excellent support for the young man on\nthe trio tracks (especially in the introspective take of &quot;'Round\nMidnight&quot;). Tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker is added on the Latin-tinged\noriginal &quot;Point of View.&quot; Like all players who demonstrate tremendous technique\nat a young age, critics will be watching Eldar Djangirov with great interest to\nsee if he successfully builds upon his amazing gifts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375d90adb1d564851829c8d07c0e4c56bdb5881d","amp;dn":"Eldar+Djangirov+-+Eldar+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375d90adb1d564851829c8d07c0e4c56bdb5881d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,93,144,173,177,213,100,133,24,41,200,208,124,14,76,86,189,181,136,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
