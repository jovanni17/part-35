So I guess it is now obsolete.  I am beginning to think that maybe Norm didn\\&amp;#039;t like his 1998 or 1999 season.  However, as usual, Norm produces one good show.  It is in avi format, from a british source. If you like it, be sure to buy other tapes/dvd/plans from Norm at newyankee.com \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b58b84166c7e8d78ea5abd8fa07b2b1ef4fe85d6","amp;dn":"New+Yankee+Workshop+-+1998+Season+Episode+10+-+Whirligig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b58b84166c7e8d78ea5abd8fa07b2b1ef4fe85d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,139,132,22,108,126,141,120,234,90,189,143,160,123,43,30,244,254,133,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
