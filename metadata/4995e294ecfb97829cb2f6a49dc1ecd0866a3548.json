On his wonderful Drop Me Off at 96th (on Scatter), he tantalized listeners with a couple of bars of &quot;I Didn&amp;#039;t Know What Time It Was.&quot; Even those who might have preferred that he stood steadfast and true to the non-idiomatic free improv &quot;tradition&quot; might have wavered slightly. Still, for those so inclined, Ballads might be a bittersweet experience. They might prefer to understand that Bailey was quite capable of playing in a traditionally, romantically beautiful manner but feel that he had no need to prove it, rather having him wend his unique way through a strange landscape. However, met on its own terms, Ballads is stunningly gorgeous, lovely melodies like &quot;Laura&quot; being passionately stroked even as they abut against Bailey&amp;#039;s questioning angularities and brusque, impolite commentary. The pure sound he elicits from his acoustic guitar is mouthwatering, so reverberant and alive. When he absolutely wrenches the melody of &quot;Stella By Starlight&quot; from the poor body of his instrument, it&amp;#039;s enough to leave one gasping. And longtime Bailey fans might simply shake their heads in disbelief when he strums with schmaltz -- as well as beauty -- the sentimental theme from &quot;My Buddy&quot; before taking it on a circuitous walk. Whether one is glad or distressed that he chose to dip his toes into these waters, Ballads is a singularly lovely recording, one that certainly stands out in Bailey&amp;#039;s oeuvre and one that is nigh impossible not to smile about and linger over. Highly recommended.\n\n1 \tLaura \tMercer, Raksin \t2:58\n2 \tWhat&amp;#039;s New? \tBurke, Haggart \t1:40\n3 \tWhen Your Lover Has Gone \tSwan \t3:18\n4 \tStella by Starlight \tWashington, Young \t7:21\n5 \tMy Melancholy Baby \tBurnett, Norton \t3:13\n6 \tMy Buddy \tDonaldson, Kahn \t1:12\n7 \tGone With the Wind \tMagidson, Wrubel \t2:06\n8 \tRockin&amp;#039; Chair \tCarmichael \t1:56\n9 \tBody and Soul \tEyton, Green, Heyman, Sour \t5:33\n10 \tGone With the Wind \tMagidson, Wrubel \t2:28\n11 \tRockin&amp;#039; Chair \tCarmichael \t2:04\n12 \tYou Go to My Head \tCoots, Gillespie \t1:47\n13 \tGeorgia on My Mind \tCarmichael, Gorrell \t4:57\n14 \tPlease Don&amp;#039;t Talk About Me When I&amp;#039;m Gone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4995e294ecfb97829cb2f6a49dc1ecd0866a3548","amp;dn":"Derek+Bailey+-+Ballads","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4995e294ecfb97829cb2f6a49dc1ecd0866a3548","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,149,226,148,236,251,151,130,156,178,246,164,157,193,236,208,134,106,53,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
