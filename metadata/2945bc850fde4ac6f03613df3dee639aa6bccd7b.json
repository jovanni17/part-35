They are often credited as one of the seminal and most influential bands in the power metal and speed metal subgenres. Ten musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Hansi KÃ¼rsch, guitarists AndrÃ© Olbrich and Marcus Siepen, and drummer Frederik Ehmke since 2005.\r\n\r\nBlind Guardian is a part of the German heavy metal scene that emerged in the mid-1980s. The band was formed in 1984 as Lucifer's Heritage by KÃ¼rsch (then also bass guitarist), Olbrich, other guitarist Markus DÃ¶rk and drummer Thomas Stauch. DÃ¶rk and Stauch both left the following year, and were replaced by Christof TheiÃŸen and Hans-Peter Frey respectively, who left as well before the end of the year. In 1987, Siepen joined and Stauch returned; under this line-up, which lasted 18 years (the longest in the band's history), the band changed their name to Blind Guardian and released their first album, Battalions of Fear, in 1988.   \r\n \r\nALBUM / TITLE: The Holy Grail (Compilation) (JÐ°Ñ€Ð°nÐµse Ð•ditiÐ¾n)\r\n    \r\nRELEASE YEAR / DATE: 2015\r\n    \r\nCOUNTRY: Germany\r\n    \r\nSTYLE: Power Metal\r\n    \r\nDURATION: 2:45:40\r\n\r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n    \r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n\r\n01.
