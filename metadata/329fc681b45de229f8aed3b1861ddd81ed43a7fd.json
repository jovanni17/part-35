Now this skeptic may even concede that she also believes that\nthese principles are true, that we have no option other than to accept them. Nevertheless, the issue for this skeptic is not whether one can show that the principles are unavoidable but whether they are true.\n\nLet us assume that there is just one such principle at stake. An appeal to self-evidence is obviously a no-starter. Deduction from higher principles? But there are none ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not if the principle is truly a first principle. Perhaps one could invoke some special coherence relation applicable to our shared system of beliefs? But why should just this relation be accepted, and even if it were, would this not imply that the principle is not foundational? And are there not coherent fictions? Recourse to an inductive argument would be insufficient because the principle conveys some mode of necessity not reducible to natural necessity. Similarly for an abductive argument appealing to the best explanation yielding only a contingent result. Social consensus? Irrelevant. Convention? Likewise. Perhaps some form of pragmatic justification? But our skeptic would quickly distinguish what works from what is true. How about a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“dialecticalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ argument? How precisely would that go, and what about the metaphysical baggage it might bring? In desperation, one might invoke ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“existential commitmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ but our persistent skeptic, even if she could understand this, would deem this psychological, not philosophical. Perhaps this project is confused or impossible. But there is a form of argument custom-tailored to resolve your quandary: a transcendental argument (TA).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329fc681b45de229f8aed3b1861ddd81ed43a7fd","amp;dn":"Transcendentally+Speaking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329fc681b45de229f8aed3b1861ddd81ed43a7fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,159,198,129,180,93,226,41,248,174,211,177,134,29,221,129,237,67,167,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
