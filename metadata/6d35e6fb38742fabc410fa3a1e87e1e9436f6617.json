Filled with images that slide into one another in a dreamlike way, from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“squeak of pine trees in a forestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Ã¢â‚¬Å“pinwheel, the babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hand,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the poem provides a precise way of seeing how layers of tenderness and danger melt into one another, inhabiting the same world.\n\nAt the center of the book, the eighteen-part title poem Ã¢â‚¬Å“GlaciologyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes readers to the core of misunderstandings as it juxtaposes the work of a glaciologist with fractured language, misread cues, and a literalness that defies conventional explanation. The lives of the glaciers are reported with a careful, scientific language that keeps readers emotionally at bay from the effects of their demise, and the speaker comments, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I consider language / mistreated these days, asked to explain itself / to justify at the same time it bears / meaning, to own up / to creation at the moment of use / only, and only that meaning.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe third section of the book further explores the tensions of life and death in ways both whimsicalÃ¢â‚¬â€by focusing on a fly, a vintage clock, rabbits, and Poland, among other subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â€and deeply serious. In the long poem Ã¢â‚¬Å“Event Horizon,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Skinner takes readers into an accident and its aftermath, which brushes too close to death. By the end of the book, however, a new focus comes into view with the birth of a grandchild in Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Things Move toward Disorder Except the Newly Created.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d35e6fb38742fabc410fa3a1e87e1e9436f6617","amp;dn":"Glaciology+-+Poems+by+Jeffrey+Skinner+%28Art+poetry+Ebook%292013%29.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d35e6fb38742fabc410fa3a1e87e1e9436f6617","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,53,230,251,56,116,47,171,196,16,250,58,30,135,225,233,67,111,102,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
