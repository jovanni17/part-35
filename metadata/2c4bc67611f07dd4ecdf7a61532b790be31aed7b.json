KennedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legend endures. Noted author and historian Thurston Clarke argues that the heart of that legend is what might have been. As we approach the anniversary of KennedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assassination, JFKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Last Hundred Days reexamines the last months of the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life to show a man in the midst of great change, finally on the cusp of making good on his extraordinary promise.\n\nKennedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last hundred days began just after the death of two-day-old Patrick Kennedy, and during this time, the president made strides in the Cold War, civil rights, Vietnam, and his personal life. While Jackie was recuperating, the premature infant and his father were flown to Boston for PatrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treatment. Kennedy was holding his sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hand when Patrick died on August 9, 1963. The loss of his son convinced Kennedy to work harder as a husband and father, and there is ample evidence that he suspended his notorious philandering during these last months of his life.\n\nAlso in these months Kennedy finally came to view civil rights as a moral as well as a political issue, and after the March on Washington, he appreciated the power of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., for the first time.\n\nThough he is often depicted as a devout cold warrior, Kennedy pushed through his proudest legislative achievement in this period, the Limited Test Ban Treaty. This success, combined with his warming relations with Nikita Khrushchev in the wake of the Cuban missile crisis, led to a dÃƒÂ©tente that British foreign secretary Sir Alec Douglas- Home hailed as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“beginning of the end of the Cold War.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThroughout his presidency, Kennedy challenged demands from his advisers and the Pentagon to escalate AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement in Vietnam. Kennedy began a reappraisal in the last hundred days that would have led to the withdrawal of all sixteen thousand U.S. military advisers by 1965.\n\nJFKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Last Hundred Days is a gripping account that weaves together KennedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s public and private lives, explains why the grief following his assassination has endured so long, and solves the most tantalizing Kennedy mystery of allÃ¢â‚¬â€not who killed him but who he was when he was killed, and where he would have led us.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nProlific popular historian Clarke (The Last Campaign: Robert F. Kennedy and 82 Days that Inspired America, 2008, etc.) argues that the charismatic president, whose achievements are generally low-rated by scholars, in his final months revealed himself as a great statesman. The book opens on August 7, 1963, when Jackie delivered a premature son whose devastating death brought the couple together. The author spends much time on JFK's personal life, not avoiding his well-known sexual appetite and often crippling medical problems. On the political front, this period saw the approval of the first nuclear test ban treaty. Kennedy was not so fortunate with his proposals to Congress for a strong civil rights bill and a tax cut to lower the very high rates Americans had been paying since World War II. Both bills stalled: Southern legislators opposed any law advancing civil rights, and Republicans, in those far-off days, considered the tax cut fiscally irresponsible. Their passage required the political skills of JFK's successor and unhappy vice president, Lyndon Johnson, universally despised by Kennedy aides as &quot;Uncle Cornpone.&quot; Clarke emphasizes that JFK yearned to withdraw American advisers from Vietnam, which seems true, but since most aides and ultimately Kennedy himself decided that a noncommunist South Vietnam was vital to American security, intervention was inevitable once it became clear that South Vietnam's army couldn't defeat the Vietcong. Clarke certainly demonstrates that three often painful years in office had taught Kennedy valuable lessons. No one can say what would have happened if he had lived, but no one will deny that he was a spectacularly appealing character, and Clarke delivers a thoroughly delightful portrait. This detailed, mostly worshipful account will not convince everyone, but few will put it down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c4bc67611f07dd4ecdf7a61532b790be31aed7b","amp;dn":"Thurston+Clarke+-+JFK%27s+Last+Hundred+Days+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c4bc67611f07dd4ecdf7a61532b790be31aed7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,75,198,118,17,240,125,212,236,223,122,97,83,43,121,11,227,26,237,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
