It is excellent quality and perfectly in sync. Enjoy!\n\n\nDisplaying his trademark dry humor and deadpan delivery, stand-up comedian Steven Wright delights a live audience in Toronto with his provocative one-line zingers. Wright unleashes a torrent of droll observations on the absurdity of modern life, from baby monitors as wiretaps to his addiction to placebos. This concert performance is a rare treat for fans of the Grammy-nominated and Oscar-winning funnyman.\n\nDuration: 1 hour 17 mins\n\nAspect ratio: 700 x 368","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cab65274d36225ea239eee6bae847cd191599708","amp;dn":"Steven.Wright.When.The.Leaves.Blow.Away.XviD.DvdRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cab65274d36225ea239eee6bae847cd191599708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,182,82,116,211,98,37,234,35,158,238,107,174,132,124,209,145,89,151,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
