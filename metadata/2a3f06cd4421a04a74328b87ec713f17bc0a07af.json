The man was a first-rate rock &amp; roller who sang just well enough to make producers, and his record label, think that he was a balladeer, and the results -- some passable (&quot;Teenage Heaven&quot;) and others less so (&quot;Am I Blue&quot;) -- are here; but the rock &amp; roll numbers, which encompass some excellent guitar-based blues (&quot;Milk Cow Blues,&quot; etc.), are the point, and these sound wonderful. As with any Cochran collection that goes over one CD, the problem here is that he didn't have that long of a career on Liberty Records (where EMI's Cochran catalog originated), and never fully realized his potential -- the ideal Cochran anthology would extend itself to include some of the live British television performances and radio appearances that have highlighted Rockstar Records' Cochran releases. The guitar playing is pretty awesome, and when it all pulls together, as it does more than three-quarters of the time here, it's an inspiring and exciting body of work, and easily makes the leap across those weaker spots.\nAll Music Review by Bruce Eder  \n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Summertime Blues\n[02] Three Steps To Heaven\n[03] Somethin' Else\n[04] Cut Across Shorty\n[05] Twenty Flight Rock\n[06] Sittin' In The Balcony\n[07] Drive In Show\n[08] Three Stars\n[09] Skinny Jim\n[10] Sweetie Pie\n[11] Completely Sweet\n[12] Pretty Girl\n[13] Tell Me Why\n[14] Undying Love\n[15] Blue Suede Shoes\n[16] Little Lou\n[17] Teresa\n[18] I Remember\n[19] Weekend\n[20] That's My Desire\n\nCD01 Play Time - 00h:42m:57s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] C'mon Everybody\n[02] Teenage Heaven\n[03] Hallelujah, I Love Her So\n[04] Long Tall Sally\n[05] Nervous Breakdown\n[06] Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie\n[07] Lonely\n[08] Am I Blue\n[09] Heart Breakin' Mama\n[10] Rock And Roll Blues\n[11] Cherished Memories\n[12] Eddie's Blues\n[13] My Way\n[14] Pink Peg Slacks\n[15] Milk Cow Blues\n[16] Boll Weevil Song\n[17] Little Angel (2003 Digital Remaster)\n[18] Mean When I'm Mad\n[19] Dark Lonely Street\n[20] Think Of Me\n\nCD02 Play Time - 00h:45m:50s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:28m:48s:\nTotal File Size....................... 438mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
