Acclaimed photographer Neil van Niekirk presents seven distinctly different lighting scenariosÃ¢â‚¬â€available light, exposure metering, a touch of flash, bounced on-camera flash, off-camera flash, video light, and hard sunlightÃ¢â‚¬â€to show readers how to manipulate the direction and quality of light, the subjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and photographerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position, and numerous other variables so as to turn a bad image into a stunning, professional-level portrait. Packed with dozens of instructional, full-color photos, this work also features 10 sample photo sessions, allowing readers the opportunity to see the seven lighting scenarios put to practice.\n\n===================================================================================\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd6207e574b9cf90cc97cd388af6b3c9a8831409","amp;dn":"Direction+and+Quality+of+Light%3A+Your++Better+Portrait+Photograph","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd6207e574b9cf90cc97cd388af6b3c9a8831409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,98,7,229,116,185,207,144,204,151,205,56,138,246,179,201,168,131,20,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
