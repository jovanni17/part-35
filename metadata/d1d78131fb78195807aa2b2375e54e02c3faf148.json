The first six issues were published by Wildstorm, but after concerns about the content of the book Wildstorm decided to cease publishing The Boys, which then moved to Dynamite Entertainment.\n\nThe series is set in a contemporary world very much like our own, with one notable exception: There are many people out there who have some form of superpower. The series follows a superpowered CIA squad, known as the Boys, whose job it is to keep watch on superheroes and, if necessary, intimidate or kill them. Ennis has said that the series will &quot;out-Preacher Preacher&quot; [1], presumably referring to the extreme violence and sexuality that were that series&amp;#039;s hallmark. He has also stated that he expects the series to last for approximately 60 issues.&quot;\n\n\nPulled from Wikipedia: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_%28comic%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_%28comic%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d78131fb78195807aa2b2375e54e02c3faf148","amp;dn":"The+Boys+Issues+1-6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d78131fb78195807aa2b2375e54e02c3faf148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,215,129,49,251,120,25,88,7,170,43,35,117,229,78,2,195,250,241,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
