All I know about them is that they are from Leuven, Belgium (hmm, my liver is kicking in and giving me a hint that Stella Artois beer is originally also from this town) and that they started playing back in 2001. They remind me mostly of the all-mighty P.A.I.N. but sounding more rougher (as in: they have this more coarse, punk sound). They are still active and gigging around so I would recommend you people go and see them if they play in a venue near you and also be sure to catch their previous album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hasta La Vista, Comandante!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b4243265f99a2cb768fd5ff17f7d0acfbc75ab","amp;dn":"USUAL+SUSPECTS%2C+THE+%5B2007%5D+Breaking+Bars+And+Crushing+Codes+%7BFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31b4243265f99a2cb768fd5ff17f7d0acfbc75ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,180,36,50,101,249,154,44,183,104,253,95,241,127,125,10,207,188,117,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
