We'll talk about using mesh-based sculpting to quickly deform and shape our geometry. We'll set up image-based sculpting in order to create sculpted detail that is all contained within a very powerful type of displacement map. \n\nWe'll also cover the use of a multi-resolution sculpting workflow. We'll talk about setting up this common type of sculpting workflow in MODO and how we can navigate the different levels. Throughout the training we'll cover common sculpting tools, brush tips and nozzle settings that will allow us to detail our creature very quickly. In the end, you'll have the knowledge you need to begin sculpting your own models in MODO.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8accb7ce536e81d1ab29c7d770e3e8d4c731214","amp;dn":"Getting+Started+with+Sculpting+in+MODO+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8accb7ce536e81d1ab29c7d770e3e8d4c731214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,172,203,124,229,54,232,29,26,178,156,125,119,14,62,141,76,115,18,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
