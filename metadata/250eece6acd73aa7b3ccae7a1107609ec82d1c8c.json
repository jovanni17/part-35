But these are also fresh interpretations that I felt that I was listening to for the first time, especially the &quot;Pavan.&quot; I have almost all of her Bach recordings and I am in the process of wearing them out! The Ravel is on that same level. Very highly recommended, even if you don't care for Ravel.
