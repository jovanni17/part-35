He&amp;#039;s had several CDs of his stand up, 3 DVDs, and bit parts in a few movies, including Boondock Saints.  These first few albums are hilarious if you&amp;#039;re familiar with Maine at all, but they&amp;#039;re also pretty damn funny if you&amp;#039;re not.  I&amp;#039;d say he&amp;#039;s one of the best stand up comedians working today.\nGive it a try-if there&amp;#039;s any interest, I have quite a few more of his albums.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28fde9d0e4539b2bf592559bf4e3de2690f6fcb3","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+%28Comedian%29+-+All+New+Stuff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28fde9d0e4539b2bf592559bf4e3de2690f6fcb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,253,233,208,228,83,155,43,245,146,85,155,244,227,222,38,144,246,252,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
