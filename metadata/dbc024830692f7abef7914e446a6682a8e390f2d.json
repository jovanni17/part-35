Reclusive comic book artist Trip Spector spends his life doodling supersquare, straitlaced superheroes, hiding from his fans, and crushing on his unattainable boss until he meets the dork of his dreams. Silas Goolsby is a rowdy FX makeup creator with a loveless love life and a secret streak of geek who yearns for unlikely rescues and a truly creative partnership. Against their better judgment, they fall victim to chemistry, and what starts as infatuation quickly grows tender and terrifying. With SilasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help, Trip gambles his heart and his art on a rotten plan: sketching out Scratch, a Ã¢â‚¬Å“very graphic novelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that will either make his name or wreck his career. But even a smash canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t save their world if Trip retreats into his mild-mannered rut, leaving Silas to grapple with betrayal and emotions he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t escape. What will it take for this dynamic duo to discover that heroes never play it safe?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbc024830692f7abef7914e446a6682a8e390f2d","amp;dn":"Suede_Damon-Bad_Idea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbc024830692f7abef7914e446a6682a8e390f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,192,36,131,6,146,247,171,239,121,20,228,70,166,104,42,142,57,15,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
