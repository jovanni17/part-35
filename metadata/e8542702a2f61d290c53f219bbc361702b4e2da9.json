The novel was never published in his lifetime, although many elements of the story were used in the novel The Dosadi Experiment, sometimes word-for-word. It contains a forward by Kevin J. Anderson who co-authored many books in the Duniverse with Brian Herbert, son of Frank Herbert.\nPlot\n\nThe novel is set on Earth following a period of warfare in the Twenty-first Century that resulted in a unified world government controlled by an ongoing series of polls registering the opinion of a sample of the population. Senior Liaitor Daniel Movius loses his government job and all the privileges associated with that position in one such poll and is demoted back to the Labor Pool, where he soon finds his very life is in danger. The negotiating skills that originally allowed Movius to work his way from the Labor Pool to the upper ranks without the benefit of nepotism serve him well as he becomes the natural leader of a revolution by the previously disorganized Seps, or Separatists, fed by the discontent of the populace as they learn the Demopol has been manipulated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8542702a2f61d290c53f219bbc361702b4e2da9","amp;dn":"high-opp+-+frank+herbert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8542702a2f61d290c53f219bbc361702b4e2da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,84,39,2,162,246,29,41,12,83,242,25,187,195,97,112,43,78,45,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
