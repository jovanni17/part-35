Although many examples, particularly in the earlier chapters, are taken from geophysics and astrophysics, the author places the emphasis frimly on generic methods and applications.\nEach chapter begins with a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“softÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ introduction, placing the discussion within an everyday context, and the level of difficulty then rises steadily, a pattern which is reflected throughout the text as a whole. The necessary mathematical tools are developed in parallel with the physics on a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“need-to-knowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ basis, an approach that avoids lengthy mathematical preliminaries.
