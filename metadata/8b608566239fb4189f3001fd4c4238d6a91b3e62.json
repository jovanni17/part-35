We headed to Europe for the World of Tanks 2015 Grand Final, and it was a pretty awesome experience. We've got all the highlights for you in one neat little package - including interviews with professional gamers from around the world, a chat with the Wargaming team including CEO Victor Kislyi, and some of the world's best Tanks gameplay, direct from the show floor.
