New World Order\n02. City of Ghosts\n03. Dead Eyes in a Dying World \n04. Beheading the Serpent\n\nwww.terrortory.com \n\n\nterrortory.bigcartel.com \n\nwww.discouragedrecords.com\n\nTerrortory has never been known to be in a hurry. Quite the opposite. In the aftermath of the events surrounding their critically acclaimed debut album &quot;The Seed Left Behind&quot;, something happened. The live perfor- mances came more frequently, and despite being scattered across 100 english miles the band started molding new songs. Sooner rather than later, the result - &quot;City of Ghosts&quot; - is upon us.\n\n&quot;City of Ghosts&quot; was initially thought of as an experiment, exploring the writing and recording possibilites a scattered group of people has in this day and age. Tommy recorded the drums in NorrkoÃŒË†ping, Olov recorded the bass guitar in Stockholm, Stefan and Emil tracked the guitars in SkellefteaÃŒÅ  and Johan screamed his lungs out in UmeaÃŒÅ . Quite soon, Terrortory realized the material was way stronger than they had hoped, and when they got Ronnie BjoÃŒË†rnstroÃŒË†m (Zonaria, Aeon, Ghamorean etc) aboard to mix the project there was no doubt &quot;City of Ghosts&quot; was going to be released to the public.\n\nThe music follows the paths lit by &quot;The Seed Left Behind&quot; but seems to transcend its predecessor. Avantgarde melodic death metal might sound fancy, but it certainly fits the bill. Albeit &quot;City of Ghosts&quot; isn't a concept album, there's a strict lyrical framework. The stories take place in a desolate town, and deals with questions such as de-populization, the big brother-society and the individual disappearing in the masses.\n\nOn their character-defining journey the band played with bands like Entombed, Vintersorg, Zonaria and Khoma and also managed to become practically an institution on TraÃŒË†stocksfestivalen, where they played alongside bands like Sonic Syndicate, Dismember, Cult of Luna, Grave- yard, and Totalt JaÃŒË†vla MoÃŒË†rker.\nThe EP is released on digital platforms march 29th by Discouraged Records (Moloken, Ghamorean, System Annihilated etc).\n\nRecorded and produced by Terrortory.\nMixed and mastered by Ronnie BjoÃŒË†rnstroÃŒË†m (Zonaria, Aeon, Ghamorean etc).\nCover art by Fredrik Aaro and Johan NorstroÃŒË†m.\n\nBand members:\nJohan NorstroÃŒË†m - vocals \nStefan Vidmark - guitar \nEmil Ceder - guitar\nOlov HaÃŒË†ggmark - bass \nTommy Nilsson - drums\n\nwww.terrortory.com \n\n\nterrortory.bigcartel.com \n\nwww.discouragedrecords.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ddc01d0c22514c0a726c09e7e5ee3814d696f8","amp;dn":"terrortory_-_city_of_ghosts_MP3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68ddc01d0c22514c0a726c09e7e5ee3814d696f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,221,192,29,12,34,81,76,10,114,108,9,231,229,238,56,20,214,150,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
