I am not seeding them all, all the time, so if you require a seed just send me a PM request and I\\\\\\'ll be happy to oblige. I just can\\\\\\'t continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you!  :-)\n\n\n\n\nThis is Matt Alber\\\\\\'s second album and, WOW, it is even BETTER than his first album!!!!\n\nHere is a link to his first album in case you missed it. &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5510017/Matt_Alber_-_Hide_Nothing_%282008%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5510017/Matt_Alber_-_Hide_Nothing_%282008%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you DO enjoy Matt\\\\\\'s music - and you WILL - then please visit his website and purchase either a download of his album or a CD - or BOTH! If we want to be able to continue to have BEAUTIFUL music like this available to us, then PLEASE support the independent artists like Matt Alber. I\\\\\\'m posting this for people to \\\\\\&quot;sample\\\\\\&quot; so they can then discover the LOVE the music and want to support the artist by purchasing the music.\n\nYou may or may not be familiar with Matt and his video for \\\\\\&quot;End Of The World\\\\\\&quot; from YouTube, and either way, check out the video and I double-dog-DARE you to NOT get goosebumps. Beautiful video for a beautiful song! \n\n\n\nBelow is a review I read online about this album that pretty much sums it all up. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\\\\\\&quot;All the promise made with his first full album, Hide Nothing, has been fulfilled and then some.\n\nFrom the beautiful waltzing lilt of the opening track Velvet Goldmine to the stripped back cover of Take a Bow(an actual Madonna cover that isn\\\\\\'t murdered and he makes his own. Who knew?!), this album never wanes.\n\nStand out tracks....well, all of them. Press play and listen all the way through. Then repeat.\n\nIt\\\\\\'s criminal that this guy is not huge. Buy it and make your friends buy it. Spread the word.\n\nOne of my top 3 albums of 2011. Outstanding!\\\\\\&quot;\n\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af20e429bdc182aea81889ef90fed8e549acd131","amp;dn":"Matt+Alber+-+Constant+Crows+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af20e429bdc182aea81889ef90fed8e549acd131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,32,228,41,189,193,130,174,168,24,137,239,144,254,216,229,73,172,209,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
