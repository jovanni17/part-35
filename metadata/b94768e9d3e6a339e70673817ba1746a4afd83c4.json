Tho footage of The Clash is tagged on to the end, to presumably give the makers a selling point, it's with the other notable movers of the times that Punk In London becomes something of an essential viewing for fans and interested observers alike.\n\nFeaturing live work from the likes of The Lurkers, X-Ray Spex, Subway Sect, Chelsea and The Adverts, this is a must see to really see just how raw the movement was before it became a viable product for record company big wigs. \nTho not all the live footage is of great quality ( you will struggle to hear Poly Styrene's vocals on Identity), watching Howard Wall of The Lurkers sing whilst being surrounded by fans is critical in portraying just how of the people the punk explosion was, it really shows the whole essence and point of punk rock, namely anyone can make a record, get up there and do it yourself. Ultimately it's with the interviews that this documentary succeeds, watch and enjoy as Gene October {lead singer of Chelsea} muses on why his band exists, and delight as Arturo Bassick of The Lurkers does an interview at his parents house whilst Mam &amp; Dad watch Top Of The Pops, featuring a performance from The Boomtown Rats singing Looking After Number One, Arturo's words at this point is crucial to how so many bands felt at the time.\n\nAlso features performances from The Electric Chairs, The Killjoys and The Jolt.\n\nRaw and patchy sums this DVD up, but really those words can best describe the Punk movement itself, honest, refreshing and totally essential.
