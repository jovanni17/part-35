A sprawling two-record set,\nhalf recorded in the studio and half live at the Royal\nFestival Hall, showcases just how versatile the Pentangle\nwere in their unique brand of English folk, jazz, Celtic,\nblues, and pop styles. Some of the live covers are easily\ntheir finest performances. Furry Lewis' &quot;Turn Your Money\nGreen,&quot; sung by the delightful Jacqui McShee, swings sweetly,\nbuttressed of course by Renbourn and Jansch's guitar\ntapestry. Charlie Mingus' &quot;Haitian Flight Song&quot; features a\ngreat solo by bassist Danny Thompson, who was easily one of\nthe finest musicians to grace the instrument. The studio\ntracks are uniformly excellent as well, especially &quot;The Time\nHas Come,&quot; which turns waltz time inside out. McShee,\nRenbourn, and Jansch all turn in career performances on this\ntrack. But these examples merely scratch the surface of the\nPentangle's peak. An awesome and delightful collection, and\nprobably their finest hour. ? Matthew Greenwald\n\n  1.   Market Song (Cox/Jansch/McShee/Renbourn/Thompson) -\n3:39\n  2.
