But he also has a secret, one that goes all the way back to the night he almost took his own life. The night Trevor Rail, a shadowy record producer with a flair for the dark and esoteric, agreed to make him a star. . . for a price.\n\nNow Billy has come to Echo Lake Studios to create the record that will make him a legend. A dark masterpiece like only Trevor Rail can fashion. But the woods of Echo Lake have a dark past, a past that might explain the mysterious happenings in the haunted church that serves as RailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main studio. As the pressure mounts on Billy to fulfill Rail's vision, it becomes clear that not everyone will survive the project.\n\nIt's time the Devil of Echo Lake had his due, and someone will have to pay.\n\nepub and mobi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df36fa9de3152824f06163ac9f5c76420d65dffb","amp;dn":"The+Devil+of+Echo+Lake+By+Douglas+Wynne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df36fa9de3152824f06163ac9f5c76420d65dffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,54,250,157,227,21,40,36,240,97,99,172,159,92,118,66,13,101,223,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
