The band's sound is harmonious and piano-based with elements of rock. Formed in 2005, the band cites U2, Coldplay, Copeland, Death Cab for Cutie and Lovedrug as its influences. Barcelona independently released their debut album, Absolutes, in September 2007. Barcelona created their own label, NBD Music, in order to be able to focus on songwriting. On December 18, 2008, the band announced that they had been signed to the major record label Universal Records. Universal Records re-mixed &quot;Absolutes&quot; and Barcelona added 4 new songs. The new version was released on April 28, 2009.\n\nSource http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_(indie_rock_band)#Discography\n\nAbsolutes (2009) \n01. Falling Out Of Trees\n02.
