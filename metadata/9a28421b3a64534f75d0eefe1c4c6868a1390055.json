Just like the first upload (24 Season 1), this one won't work with outdated decoders. You must use VLC Player (2.0+) or Media Player Classic with some recent decoder (CoreAVC 3.0+ for example). Can't tell you when I'm gonna upload season three, stay tuned.\n\nAgain, all episodes got cleaned up before encoding. Should be a lot more pleasent to watch compared to the noisy DVDs. I also applied some sharpening to get (somewhat) rid of the blurred DVD feeling.\n\n\nOriginal: http://bayimg.com/mAPopaADG\nCleanup: http://bayimg.com/mApooAAdG\n\nNot all episodes share the same resolution. Black borders, overlapped borders and some errors were cropped.\n\n\nSource: DVD9 PAL\nVideo: x264 2200 x64 10bit @crf 18 using very slow settings\nAudio: English and German untouched streams (English is default) AC3 @448/384kbps 6Ch\nFilters: ColorMatrix, FFT3DGPU (prefiltering), MDegrain3, aWarpSharp2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a28421b3a64534f75d0eefe1c4c6868a1390055","amp;dn":"24+-+Season+2+-+High+Quality+x264+-+Eng%2C+Ger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a28421b3a64534f75d0eefe1c4c6868a1390055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,40,66,27,58,100,83,79,117,208,238,254,28,76,104,104,161,57,0,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
