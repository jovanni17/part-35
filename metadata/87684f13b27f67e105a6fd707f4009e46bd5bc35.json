The book starts with the basics of condensed matter physics and advances toward the strong electron correlation system stage. It also provides up-to-date information on topics, such as thermoelectric power, superconductivity, solid oxide fuel cells, and nanostructure effect.\n\nAbout the Author\nTsuyoshi Takami is an assistant professor at Osaka University and editor of the journal Nanothermoelectrics. He previously worked at the University of Texas at Austin and Nagoya University and received the 24th Ando Incentive Prize for the Study of Electronics. He earned his Ph.D. from Nagoya University. \n\nCONTENTS\nPreface vii\nAcknowledgments ix\n2 Spin-State Crossover 27\n3 Li Ion Battery 45\n4 Huge Thermoelectric Power 57\n5 Room-Temperature Ferromagnetism 75\n6 Partially Disordered Antiferromagnetic Transition 85\n7 Superconductivity 109\n8 Transport Properties Combined with Charge, Spin, and Orbital: Magnetoresistance and Spin Blockade 121\n9 Intrinsic Inhomogeneity 137\n10 Move/Diffuse and Charge/Discharge Effect 155","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87684f13b27f67e105a6fd707f4009e46bd5bc35","amp;dn":"Functional+Cobalt+Oxides+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87684f13b27f67e105a6fd707f4009e46bd5bc35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,104,79,19,178,127,103,225,5,166,253,112,127,64,9,228,107,213,188,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
