After spending time in the N.Y.C. band Creaky Floors, Deez formed the band that sports his name and released the infectious indie pop single â€œConstellations.â€ Live shows where the bandmembers entered dancing to â€œPeanut Butter Jelly Timeâ€ made them the talk of the Brooklyn hipster set, while the U.K. caught on thanks to their early-2010 single &quot;Radar Detector&quot; and its extremely bonkers video. That same year the band collected all its best â€œhappy songs for sad peopleâ€ for a self-titled debut album released by the Lucky Number label","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73393294ba021ded971bddb15ca44a90fe8edf75","amp;dn":"Darwin+Deez+-+Double+Down+%282015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73393294ba021ded971bddb15ca44a90fe8edf75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,57,50,148,186,2,29,237,151,27,221,177,92,164,74,144,254,142,223,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
