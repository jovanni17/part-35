Not the Impossible Faith is a tour de force in that genre, dissecting and refuting the oft-repeated claim that Christianity could not have succeeded in the ancient world unless it was true.\n\nThough framed as a detailed rebuttal to Christian apologist J.P. Holding (author of The Impossible Faith), Carrier takes a general approach that educates the reader on the history and sociology of the ancient world, answering many questions like: How did Christians approach evidence? Was there a widespread prejudice against the testimony of women? Was resurrection such a radical idea? Who would worship a crucified criminal? And much more.\n\nWritten with occasional humor and an easy style, and thoroughly referenced, with many entertaining &quot;gotcha!&quot; moments, Not the Impossible Faith is a must-read for anyone interested in the origins of Christianity. \n\nAuthor: Richard Carrier\nPublisher: Lulu.com\nPublication: February 10, 2009\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b937414ef6f14fbb61dc36d40eb4985b7e06b6c5","amp;dn":"Richard+Carrier+-+Not+the+Impossible+Faith+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b937414ef6f14fbb61dc36d40eb4985b7e06b6c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,55,65,78,246,241,79,187,97,220,54,212,14,180,152,91,126,6,182,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
