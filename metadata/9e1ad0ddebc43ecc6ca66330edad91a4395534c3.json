Reoent improvements in our understanding of algebraio surfaoes\nover fields of positive oharaoteristio allowed us to approaoh the subject from a\ncompletely geometrio point of view although heavily relying on algebraio methods.\nSome of the techniques presented in this book oan be applied to the study of\nalgebraic surfaces of other types. We hope that it will make this book of partioular\ninterest to a wider range of research mathematioians and graduate students.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e1ad0ddebc43ecc6ca66330edad91a4395534c3","amp;dn":"%5BDJVU%5D+%5B1989%5D+Enriques+Surfaces+%28Progress+in+Mathematics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e1ad0ddebc43ecc6ca66330edad91a4395534c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,26,208,221,235,196,62,204,108,166,99,48,237,173,145,164,57,85,52,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
