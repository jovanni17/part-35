Seriously.\n\nSo why would I make a torrent out of it? Because I've yet to find a better PDF for this particular book, and 'something' is slightly better than 'nothing.' (It's like a busted-up library book, but without the aura of pestilence.)\n\n\nI fiddled around with pdftk for a few minutes to see if could improve the error situation. Alas, no go. (And, I'll be honest, I didn't try for long.)\n\nSo if you find a better PDF of this book, please use it instead, and pretend this torrent never existed. Until then, at least you can see what the end-of-chapter exercises are, that you were assigned for class. (Hopefully. I didn't actually check to see if those pages were all error-free.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26057e849092f217e0bce86a09f1e59674966642","amp;dn":"Connecting+with+Computer+Science%2C+2nd+Ed.+Anderson%2C+Ferro%2C+Hilto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26057e849092f217e0bce86a09f1e59674966642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,5,126,132,144,146,242,23,224,188,232,106,9,241,229,150,116,150,102,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
