And see it again, just to understand it. \nIf ever there was a European movie (besides Betty Blue) this is it! And if ever there was a European soundtrack - this is it! \nBregovic is a genius miner of musical heritage of the continent, or rather of his home country - former Yugoslavia. And what jewels he brought us! \nSome of the songs worked so well that I never realized that I was watching a French movie (the book was written by Alexander Dumas) with traditional Croatian music in the background. Or a synthesis of Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian tunes. David Bowie put it best:&quot;The end of twentieth century is about juxtaposition of information.&quot; And look what comes out when You do it right. \nBut, besides all this - this is just fantastic music from a great composer and skilled craftsman that was lucky to have happened to live in a great place at a great time.(Customer from Amazon)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img695.imageshack.us/img695/4531/frontsq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img695.imageshack.us/img695/4531/frontsq.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n01 - Elo Hi (Canto Nero) (Feat.
