It provides a detailed discussion of the principles behind the training of working dogs, and reveals little-known methods for training and handling sheep dogs in the most effortless manner.\n\nThe text is divided into six major sections covering the instincts of the working dog, breeding, principles of training, methods of training, handling livestock and sheep dog trials. Photographs and line drawings help to illustrate best techniques when training dogs, such as how to teach dogs to cast, muster and drive.\n\nContaining the first comprehensive breakdown and analysis of the instincts of the working dog, and discussing the various principles and methods of their breeding, this book is a practical reference for farmers and stockmen, hobby and lifestyle farmers, sheep dog trial competitors and breeders of working dogs.\n\n\nPaperback: 280 pages\nPublisher: CSIRO Publishing; 1 edition (April 30, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0643093435\nISBN-13: 978-0643093430","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06001c1ca1017a98f7880208de04701ad7bc8854","amp;dn":"Working+Sheep+Dogs%3A+A+Practical+Guide+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06001c1ca1017a98f7880208de04701ad7bc8854","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,0,28,28,161,1,122,152,247,136,2,8,222,4,112,26,215,188,136,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
