This book describes the principles of MEMS via a unified approach and closed-form solutions to micromechanical problems, which have been recently developed by the author and go beyond what is available in other texts. The closed-form solutions allow the reader to easily understand the linear and nonlinear behaviors of MEMS and their design applications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:550146c29f77dcf48784e2d2e4954874f159bbde","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Microelectromechanical+Systems+%282011%29+-+%28Malestrom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"550146c29f77dcf48784e2d2e4954874f159bbde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,1,70,194,159,119,220,244,135,132,226,210,228,149,72,116,241,89,187,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
