It not only tells you what tests are needed but also describes all of them step-by-step with the help of colour photos. Sample forms show how to verify recorded test results and how to certify and fill in the required documentation. The book is also packed with handy advice on how to avoid and solve common problems encountered on the job.\n\nWith its focus on the practical side of the actual inspection and testing rather than just the requirements of the regulations, this book is ideal for students, experienced electricians and those working in allied industries, such as plumbers and heating specialists, kitchen and bathroom fitters, alarm installers and others, whether they are working on domestic or industrial installations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7175dc8b0db8831d1e5f2d0f876687ccd9b42a8","amp;dn":"Practical+Guide+to+Inspection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7175dc8b0db8831d1e5f2d0f876687ccd9b42a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,23,93,200,176,219,136,49,209,229,242,208,248,118,104,124,205,155,66,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
