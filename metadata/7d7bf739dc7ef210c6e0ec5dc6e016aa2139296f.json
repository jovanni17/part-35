What caused their outburst of violence and restless creativity, what sustained it, and what Ã¯Â¬ï¿½nally brought it to an end?\n\nRobert FergusonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new history sheds light on some of the most characteristic aspects of the VikingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ culture, including their Heathen religion, their skill as shipbuilders and architects, and an extraordinary literary and poetic culture that celebrated the deeds of such enigmatically named leaders as Harald Bluetooth and Ivar the Boneless. This is the clearest and most compelling modern portrait of the Viking world yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7bf739dc7ef210c6e0ec5dc6e016aa2139296f","amp;dn":"Robert+Ferguson+-+The+Hammer+and+the+Cross%3A+A+New+History+of+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7bf739dc7ef210c6e0ec5dc6e016aa2139296f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,123,247,57,220,126,242,16,198,224,236,93,198,224,22,170,33,57,41,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
