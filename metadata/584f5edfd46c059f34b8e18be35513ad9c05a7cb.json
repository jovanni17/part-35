Whiskeytown led the wave of insurgent-country bands that came of age with No Depression magazine in the mid-1990s, and for many people it defined the era. Adams was an irrepressible character, one of the signature personalities of his generation, and as a singer-songwriter he blew people away with a mature talent that belied his youth. David Menconi witnessed most of Whiskeytown's rocket ride to fame as the music critic for the Raleigh News &amp; Observer, and in Ryan Adams, he tells the inside story of the singer's remarkable rise from hardscrabble origins to success with Whiskeytown, as well as Adams's post-Whiskeytown self-reinvention as a solo act.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:584f5edfd46c059f34b8e18be35513ad9c05a7cb","amp;dn":"David+Menconi+-+Ryan+Adams+%28Losering%2C+a+Story+of+Whiskeytown%29.ep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"584f5edfd46c059f34b8e18be35513ad9c05a7cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,79,94,223,212,108,5,159,52,184,225,139,227,85,19,173,156,5,167,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
