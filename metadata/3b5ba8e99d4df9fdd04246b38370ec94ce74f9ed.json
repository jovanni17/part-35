This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nI got a little carried away with this one because its original broadcast date was one day before my 18th birthday. Also this was one of the first rebroadcasts of AT40 I ever recorded so nobody was more disappointed than I that I didn't get the whole thing. It is what it is.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nOne act in the countdown has a singer who only had to pass a one note audition.\n\nOne American act in the countdown was formed overseas.\n\nAnd there is a new band called Men At Work.\n \nLw#3: Abracadabra Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Steve Miller Band\nLw#2: Hurts So Good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Cougar\nLw#1: Eye Of The Tiger - Survivor\n40:    Love Or Let Me Be Lonely Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Davis\n39:    Never Been In Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Randy Meisner\n38:    Let Me Go Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ray Parker Jr.    \n37:    Do You Wanna Touch Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts     \n36:     Someday, Somewhere Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Marshall Crenshaw\n35:    WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Forever For Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Michael Murphy    \n34:    Hold On - Santana\n33:    I Keep ForgettinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Michael McDonald\n32:    DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t You Want Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Human League\n31:    Tainted Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Soft Cell\n30:    Let Me Tickle Your Fancy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jermaine Jackson\n29:    SomebodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Baby Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jackson Browne    \n28:    Hot In the City Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billy Idol\n27:    Let It Whip Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dazz Band\n26:    Blue Eyes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elton John\nLdd: Lost In Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Air Supply\n25:    Kids In America Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kim Wilde\n24:    Only Time Will Tell - Asia\n23:    You Can Do Magic - America\n22:    And IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Telling You IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Not Going Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jennifer Holliday\n21:    Out of Work Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gary U.S. Bonds\n20:    Rosanna - Toto\n19:    Only the Lonely Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Motels\n18:    Who Can It Be Now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Men At Work\n17:    Think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m In Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eddie Money\n16:    American Music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Pointer Sisters\n15:    Eye In The Sky Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Alan Parsons Project\n14:    Jack and Diane Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Cougar\n13:    Love Will Turn You Around Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Rogers\n12:    Love Is In Control Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Donna Summer\nExtra: Happy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Rolling Stones\n11:    You Should Hear How She Talks About You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Melissa Manchester\n10:    Take It Away Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul McCartney\n9:    Wasted On The Way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Crosby, Stills And Nash\n8:    Vacation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Go-GoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nLdd: Believe It Or Not Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joey Scarbury\n7:    Keep The Fire BurninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reo Speedwagon\nExtra: Proud Mary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Creedence Clearwater Revival\n6:    Even The Nights Are Better Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Air Supply\n5:    Hard To Say IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Sorry - Chicago\n4:    Hold Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fleetwood Mac\n3:    Abracadabra Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Steve Miller Band\n2:    Hurts So Good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Cougar (partially missing)\n1:    Eye Of The Tiger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Survivor (completely missing)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b5ba8e99d4df9fdd04246b38370ec94ce74f9ed","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1982_August_28th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b5ba8e99d4df9fdd04246b38370ec94ce74f9ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,91,168,233,157,77,249,253,208,66,70,179,131,112,236,148,206,116,249,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
