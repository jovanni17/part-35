McEvoy though, even then, always seemed more relevant than many of her counterparts on the album.\n\nMcEvoy has a knack of writing songs with memorable melodies and honest lyrics. Her new album Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d Rather Go BlondeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is no different. The first single from the album Ã¢â‚¬ËœLook Like MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is an upbeat track with minimalist production about being yourself and conforming to what others think.\n\nThe combination of upbeat and slower songs throughout the album are paced so each one is given the attention it deserves. Ã¢â‚¬ËœJust for the TouristsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a midtempo-ed track that builds, with a memorable refrain and melody.\n\nAt 2 minutes 11 seconds the title track Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d Rather Go BlondeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the shortest track on the album. As on Ã¢â‚¬ËœLook At MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, McEvoy has gone for a minimalist production but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem like that. The fusion of drums and string section are more than enough to fill your auditory senses.\n\nPainting a picture with words and music is a fantastic knack to have. The life of a working musician in Ã¢â‚¬ËœAway From YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ does exactly that. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a thought provoking track with beautiful production and the best use of a banjo since that Ã¢â‚¬ËœLose Your WayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ song from DawsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creek.\n\nThe first religious reference I can remember in McEvoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music was on Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Following MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Precious Little. The church organ sound and Ã¢â‚¬ËœmonkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ singing in Ã¢â‚¬ËœDeliver MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are right up that street before Ms McEvoy utters a single note. Here we find clever plays on words, a gospel-esqe drum rhythm and a seriously catchy Ã¢â‚¬ËœrefrainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Would love to hear this live with a huge gospel choir.\n\nOne of the endearing things about Eleanor McEvoy is that throughout her career she has never tried to change her vocal style, meaning her actual accent comes across. Being successfully able to get some Gaeilge into a song without it sounding out of place, is now another favourite. She does exactly that in Ã¢â‚¬ËœShibbolethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a song with delicate vocals and childlike production and almost like a lullaby.\n\nMcEvoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to write honest lyrics make her songs real and relevant. One of the many standout tracks is Ã¢â‚¬ËœTake You HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, subtle string section, great drums, really great vocals altogether seem to lay McEvoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul bare for all to see. Sublime.\n\nSometimes towards the end of an album an artist puts not the best tracks in there. This album doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have any of those. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Thought of YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a bluesy affair, if I ever make a movie with a scene of musicians in a smokey bar, Ms McEvoy, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the gig.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœHarbourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is this albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhisper A Prayer To The MoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, subtle and melodic, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be singing it without even realizing. Ã¢â‚¬ËœFor Avoidance Of Any DoubtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a clever play on a solicitors correspondence with a client following the non return of a phone call. McEvoy choses to end the album with her sultry rendition of Sam CookeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœGood TimesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nWith this album, Eleanor McEvoy has outclassed herself with her lyrics, vocals and overall production. Twenty years into a career? Sounds like sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just been warming up.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f614a02f450068477947a35da45ba7794d155e6","amp;dn":"Eleanor+McEvoy+-+I%27d+Rather+Go+Blonde+%5B2010%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f614a02f450068477947a35da45ba7794d155e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,97,74,2,244,80,6,132,119,148,122,53,218,69,186,119,148,209,85,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
