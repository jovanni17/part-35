Plants are also important, as different plants can be grown and harvested for different purposes. Players must use the various plant and animal species available to them (as well as hybrid animals) to deal with different environments, enemies, and tasks. For instance, a crab is a good armored defender, while a mule is a perfect detritus transporter. The two can be bred to form a creature that is well armored, but also suited to mule work. The more a particular species has been studied and created, the more effective future individuals will be. The primary resource of the game is goop, which is derived from all kinds of biomass.\n\n------------------------------\n\nIt needs DosBox to play.\n\n1) Unpack the rar\n2) Mount the iso with your chosen software (I recommend Daemon tools lite)\n3) Install\n4) Add these lines to the end of the dosbox conf txt (remember to remove all the &quot;-&quot;):\n\n\nmount C -dir where genewars.exe is-\nmount D -letter of the virtual drive-:\nc:\ngenewars\n\n\n5) Start DosBox\t\n\n--------------------------------\nPirate bay seems to delete the bar you have to add after the colon in the cirtual drive. It is the bar leaning to the left.
