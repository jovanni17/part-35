The world is delighted when a space craft containing a crew made up of the world's astronauts lands on the moon, they think for the first time. But the delight turns to shock when the astronauts discover an old British flag and a document declaring that the moon is taken for Queen Victoria proving that the astronauts were not the first men on the moon. On Earth, an investigation team finds the last of the Victorian crew - a now aged Arnold Bedford and he tells them the story of how he and his girlfriend, Katherine Callender, meet up with a inventor, Joseph Cavor, in 1899. Cavor has invented Cavorite, a paste that will allow anything to deflect gravity and he created a sphere that will actually take them to the moon. Taking Arnold and accidently taking Katherine they fly to the moon where, to their total amazement, they discover a bee-like insect population who take a unhealthy interest in their Earthly visitors.\n\nReview From IMDB\n\nIf you've read the book, you know H.G. Wells wrote a lot of stuff about the Moon that would be ridiculous to modern audiences. It was more fantasy than science fiction especially the explosion of plant growth which was silly even when the book was written since anyone would have seen that through a telescope on Earth. They wisely left out almost all of these in the movie to make it somewhat more serious.\nMost of the good parts have been left in. Cavor is just as eccentric as he was in the book. Wells' detailed description of the underground society is much too brief so many of the insights in the book are lost (perhap Henryhausen's Dynamation work was too expensive or they felt audiences would be bored) and nearly all of the adventures in the jungle of the Moon have been removed since the Moon in the movie has no atmosphere or plant life. The book's ending of course is entirely different here and while it's disappointingly familiar, it's certainly more of an ending. Sandwiching the original story as a flashback in a modern moon landing was very clever and worked perfectly.\nSince every science fiction movie in the 50's and 60's needed a pretty woman to be saved by the hero from evil-looking aliens, they had to add the character of Kate Callender. Unfortunately she is a constant distraction from what was a more contentious and entertaining relationship between Cavor and Bedford in the book. They should have left her on Earth.\nAnother entertaining aspect of this movie is how they depicted a modern moon landing. The idea of landing a separate lunar module on the surface while the main craft stays in orbit around the Moon was just one of many ideas on the drawing board in 1964 (and wasn't yet the most popular). It's also amusing that the surface of the Moon is shown as a dark place with brown dirt and sharp peaked mountains instead of the blinding bright gray rocky rolling hills we saw in the real Moon landings. Fortunately NASA scientists knew about ladders so our astronauts would not have to dangle from a rope to be lowered to the surface.  \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bb6ef23fb3381ea88b2af88f6f6e93c1a052122","amp;dn":"First+Men+in+the+Moon+-+%28Edward+Judd+-+Lionel+Jeffries%29%281964%29Dvd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bb6ef23fb3381ea88b2af88f6f6e93c1a052122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,182,239,35,251,51,129,234,136,178,175,136,246,246,233,60,26,5,33,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
