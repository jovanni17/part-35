A concerto is exciting in ways that no other instrumental music can match. Where a symphony enthralls us with themes that are contrasted, varied, transformed, and developed, a concerto adds the extra dimension of human drama-the exhilaration of a soloist or group of soloists ringing forth against the mass of the orchestra.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that the concerto grew out of the same musical setting in 17th-century Italy that gave birth to opera. And like opera, the concerto is a vehicle for the depiction of every human emotion and relationship imaginable, from the gentlest and most tender to the most violent and confrontational, and everything in between.\n\nThe concerto is also an extreme sport for soloists, representing musical life lived at the edge, as instruments and the musicians who play them are pushed to the very limit of what is possible by composers exploring the extremes of instrumental virtuosity.\n\nBest of all, the concerto repertoire is huge! The genre was invented long before the symphony. As a result, Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Corelli, and Telemann composed hundreds of concerti, but among them not a single symphony. Mozart's great concerti far outnumber his great symphonies; Beethoven wrote almost as many concerti as symphonies; and Brahms composed equal numbers of both. During the 18th and 19th centuries, at least as many concerti were composed as symphonies. And during the 20th century, in terms of sheer quantity, the concerto was by far the single most important genre of orchestral music.\n\nThrills, drama, emotion, virtuosity, and a vast repertoire-what more could a music lover ask? \n\n\n24 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture \n\n\n1  The Voice in the Wilderness \n2  The Baroque Italian Concerto \n3  Baroque Masters \n4  BachÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Brandenburg Concerti \n5  Mozart, Part 1 \n6  Mozart, Part 2 \n7  Classical Masters \n8  Beethoven \n9  The Romantic Concerto \n10 Hummel and Chopin \n11 Mendelssohn and Schumann \n12 Romantic Masters \n13 Tchaikovsky \n14 Brahms and the Symphonic Concerto \n15 Dvorak \n16 Rachmaninoff \n17 The Russian Concerto, Part 1 \n18 The Russian Concerto, Part 2 \n19 The Concerto in France \n20 Bartok \n21 SchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nberg, Berg and the 12-Tone Method \n22 Twentieth-Century Masters \n23 Elliott Carter \n24 Servants to the Cause and Guilty Pleasures ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ae638d16764e558b901d59b353946598fbd3b43","amp;dn":"TTC+-+The+Concerto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ae638d16764e558b901d59b353946598fbd3b43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,230,56,209,103,100,229,88,185,1,213,155,53,57,70,89,143,189,59,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
