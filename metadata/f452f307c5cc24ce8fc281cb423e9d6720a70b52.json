Although his success lasted only a year and a half before his death in an airplane crash, Holly is described by critic Bruce Eder as &quot;the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll.&quot; His works and innovations inspired and influenced contemporary and later musicians, notably The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Eric Clapton, and exerted a profound influence on popular music. Holly was among the first group of inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Holly #13 among &quot;The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to Me: Buddy Holly is a tribute album to rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“n roll pioneer Buddy Holly, in celebration of what would have been his 75th birthday in 2011.
