He travels around the country as he explores the United Kingdom's remarkable past, from the perspective of ordinary people. It's wide-ranging, beautifully filmed and a bit sentimental, but also hugely informative and full of good humour. Nobody does this sort of thing better.\n\n\n\n7)  Industry and Empire \nMichael Wood explores the many ways in which the Industrial Revolution transformed society during the 19th century, as towns and cities grew while the rural population shrank and Britain became the world's first industrial power. He discovers how this economic shift affected workers, visiting communities in Dorset and Wiltshire, as well as the site of a former slum in Manchester, and investigates the roles of slavery and colonialism in driving British expansion. He also travels to mines and factories that thrived during the period, and learns how the ideas of Enlightenment thinkers revolutionised the way people viewed the world.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1562 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d027c3beb7ebb4b3c590d9e4622efe857a987f03","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Great+British+Story+A+People+History+Season+1+7of8+Indus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d027c3beb7ebb4b3c590d9e4622efe857a987f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,39,195,190,183,235,180,179,197,144,217,228,98,46,254,133,122,152,127,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
