After graduating, he moved to his native Austria, where his music began to flourish. In 1966, he formed the popular folk group, 'Jack's Angels', who signed a 4-album record deal with Amadeo Records in Vienna. The group was short-lived, but Jack continued to record three more solo albums for the label and had a number of songs climb the European pop charts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b8cb8eff5ec215694b59715b3b47a320cb1af43","amp;dn":"Jack+Grunsky+%26amp%3B+Jack%27s+Angels+-+Icarus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b8cb8eff5ec215694b59715b3b47a320cb1af43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,140,184,239,245,236,33,86,148,181,151,21,179,180,122,50,12,177,175,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
