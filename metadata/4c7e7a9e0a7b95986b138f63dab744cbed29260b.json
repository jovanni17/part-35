They're a somewhat rare breed; however, in recent years their numbers have been dramatically increasing. In fact, Sean Michaels sees them all the time. They're usually in the backyard of his beautiful estate, and sure enough, as Sean's entertaining some guests, one suddenly appeared! There's a few tricks involved when capturing a Snow Bunny. First off, you much approach one in a slow, deliberate manner. It always helps to have some swag when doing this. Always talk to a Snow Bunny in a confident, cool tone. And finally, Snow Bunnies are always attracted to African-American males. If you follow the aforementioned guidelines, not only can one catch a Snow Bunny, well...you can pretty much have your way with one.
