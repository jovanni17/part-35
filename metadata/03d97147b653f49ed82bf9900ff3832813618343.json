The detailed introduction and explanatory notes address many previously unexplained issues. Texts have been fully collated and edited according to modern principles and are accompanied with a textual introduction and full textual apparatus.\n\nReview\n\n'Some of the most important publishing events take place quietly ... one of the landmark publications for me was the appearance of ... A Tale of a Tub and Other Works ... It's heartening to know, not just that one of our greatest writers is finally being given the editorial treatment he deserves, but that such a quixotically ambitious publishing series can still be contemplated in the digital age.' Jonathan Coe, The Guardian\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03d97147b653f49ed82bf9900ff3832813618343","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Swift+-+The+Tale+of+a+Tub+%26amp%3B+Other+Works+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03d97147b653f49ed82bf9900ff3832813618343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,217,113,71,182,83,244,158,216,43,249,144,15,243,131,40,19,97,131,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
