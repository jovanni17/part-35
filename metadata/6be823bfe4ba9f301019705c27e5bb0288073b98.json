The father of the shattered victim refuses to rest until justice is done, so he begins his own investigation. Keeping watch over his daughter's apartment from the street, he notices Ziv Nevo lurking in the shadows.\n\nAll circumstancesÃ¢â‚¬â€and the victimÃ¢â‚¬â€point to Nevo's guilt, and it appears the case is closed. But appearances can be deceiving. Detective Eli Nachum is eager to wrap up this high-profile case, which threatens to thwart his career. He sees an easy conviction when the father, determined to succeed where the police have failed, hands over Nevo. But why does the suspect keep silent during the interrogation? What secret is he hiding? What should Nachum and the idealistic young district attorney understand from the suspect's silence?\n\nWhat unfolds is a brilliant, fast-paced story that will keep you guessing until the very last page. Lineup is a twisted tale of mistaken identity, organized crime, a disgraced detective looking for redemption, a tireless young reporter, and an innocent man with a not-so-innocent past. Which lines will they cross and what will they be willing to risk, as their worlds begin to collapse? This seamless, gripping novel introduces a powerful new voice in crime fiction.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6be823bfe4ba9f301019705c27e5bb0288073b98","amp;dn":"Lineup+by+Liad+Shoham+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6be823bfe4ba9f301019705c27e5bb0288073b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,232,35,191,228,186,159,48,16,25,112,92,39,229,187,2,136,7,59,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
