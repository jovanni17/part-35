It is commonly used to determine \na computer's performance with a game, as well as record gaming footage. \n\nThe program is very popular in the making of amateur machinima films.\nFraps can take screenshots in various formats: BMP, TGA, JPEG, and PNG. \n(However, only the BMP format is available in the freeware version.) \n\nIn its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can best be described as:\n- Realtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record video while \n  playing your favourite game? Come join the Machinima revolution! Throw away \n  the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game recording has never been this easy! \n  Fraps can capture audio and video up to 2560x1600 with custom frame rates from \n  10 to 100 frames per second! \n- Benchmarking Software - Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you are getting \n  in a corner of your screen. Perform custom benchmarks and measure the frame \n  rate between any two points. Save the statistics out to disk and use them for \n  your own reviews and applications.\n- Screen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a key! \n  There's no need to paste into a paint program every time you want a new shot. \n  Your screen captures are automatically named and timestamped.\n\nThe lossless Fraps codec allows decoding of Fraps-encoded videos (using a media \nplayer capable of decoding the AVI container format) or transcoding to other \nvideo formats (with the use of the right software). The Fraps video codec manages \nto capture videos with minimal impact on game performance, as it has been \noptimized to achieve compression higher than uncompressed RGB, resulting in \nsmaller filesizes, though the lossless format is considerably less space-efficient \nthan more heavily compressed lossy video formats such as DivX. This is because \nencoding on-the-fly to a high-compression format such as DivX would have a large \nnegative impact on game performance (as of 2007) and only a very fast hard drive \ncould record the immense amount of data produced in using uncompressed video. \nThe Fraps format is a compromise of the two.\n\nFraps 3 - New features and a new look!  \n- Fraps is now compatible with Windows 7 and the latest DirectX 11 games.\n- Ventrilo &amp; TeamSpeak users have long wanted a way to record their microphone \n  and speakers at the same time.  \n- For Windows 7 and Vista we've added realtime sound mixing to our video recording \n  so you can now capture both sides of the conversation!\n\nNVIDIA have recently included stereoscopic 3D support directly into their drivers. \nIf you play your DirectX9 (D3D9) game with 3D Vision enabled you can use Fraps to\nrecord the game in full 3D too!  You'll get a side-by-side stereo AVI recording \nthat you can drop straight in to a stereoscopic 3D player!\n\nFinally, we are aware that more and more people are putting Fraps to professional \nuse. We've added a new option to force lossless RGB compression to ensure that you \nalways have the highest quality video output to work with.\n\n\nChanges in Fraps 3.4.0 - 29th Mar 2011:\n***************************************\n- Added configurable buffer size for loop recording mode.\n- Increased video capture performance at high resolutions.\n- Fixed slow recording of Minecraft at default window size.\n- Fixed benchmark crashing when configured to stop automatically after 1 second.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n********************\n- DirectX 9.0c or DirectX 10\n- Requires Administrator rights\n- Supports all modern CPU's (Pentium 3 and above)\n- Captures fastest with an NVIDIA GeForce or ATI Radeon graphics card\n- Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista and Windows 7\n\n\nMore info:\n********** &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fraps.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fraps.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b7c34f981bc4a6d5dbf2dd56e35041c6a093b7","amp;dn":"Fraps+v3.4.0+%28Full+Registered+Version%29.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b7c34f981bc4a6d5dbf2dd56e35041c6a093b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,183,195,79,152,27,196,166,213,219,242,221,86,227,80,65,198,160,147,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
