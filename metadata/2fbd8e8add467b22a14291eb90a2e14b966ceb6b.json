In the Netherlands the single peaked at No. 1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fbd8e8add467b22a14291eb90a2e14b966ceb6b","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+410","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fbd8e8add467b22a14291eb90a2e14b966ceb6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,189,142,138,221,70,123,34,161,66,145,235,144,162,225,75,150,108,235,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
