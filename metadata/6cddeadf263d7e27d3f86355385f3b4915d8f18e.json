Perez (Xlibris, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781436339858\r\n\r\nThis book was specifically written for process operators who regularly deal with centrifugal pumps, addressing principally those variables and factors under their control, while limiting design theory and mathematics to a minimum. The following topics are covered:\r\n\r\n1. Importance of equipment reliability and what role operators play in this mission. \r\n2. Centrifugal pump operating characteristics \r\n3. Mechanical seals and their related seal flush plans\r\n4. What operators should know about electric motors \r\n5. Lubrication basics \r\n6. Troubleshooting basics \r\n7. How to start a pump reliability program \r\n\r\nBy the end of the book, the reader should possess a clear understanding of how to operate and monitor their pumps. Three handy references are also contained in the book to answer questions as they arise in the field: 1) Operatorâ€™s Guide to API Flush Plans, 2) Illustrated Glossary of Centrifugal Pump Terms, 3) Glossary of Electric Motor Terms, and 4) Useful Centrifugal Pump Formulas.\r\n\r\nThis book can be used as a self-paced, self-taught short course or as a companion to a â€œliveâ€ prepared short course for both inexperienced and seasoned operators. It can also serve as a handy field guide after completion of the course. The ultimate mission of this book is to provide the latest generation of operators a body of knowledge that is relevant, complete, and practical in an industrial setting for years to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cddeadf263d7e27d3f86355385f3b4915d8f18e","amp;dn":"Operator%26rsquo%3Bs+Guide+to+Centrifugal+Pumps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cddeadf263d7e27d3f86355385f3b4915d8f18e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,221,234,223,38,61,126,39,211,248,99,85,56,95,59,73,21,216,241,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
