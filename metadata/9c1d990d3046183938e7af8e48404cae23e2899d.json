It saw the use of military equipment on\na scale never experienced before. One of the most popular and\nmost often employed vehicles of that time was the tank.

In Tank Combat, you can\nbecome the commander of each of them!\n\nTake the helm of the most famous tanks of the Second World\nWar; the American ?General Stuart?, the German ?Tiger? and the\ninfamous Soviet T34. Each vehicle was recreated with an\nincredible attention to detail and great faithfulness to the\noriginal.\n\nParticipate in three dramatic campaigns: skirmishes in\nNorthern Africa, the siege of Leningrad and the defence of the\nGerman Vaterland. Fight on realistic battlefields, in changing\nweather conditions, and destroy nearly every element of the\nsurroundings (vehicles, trees and buildings).\n\nParticipate in the dynamic combat of the most powerful\nmachines of World War II\n\nThree single-player campaigns: Allied, German and Russian.\n\nArcade-type gameplay allows for easy control of the vehicles\n\nAdapt to the changing conditions of the battlefield ? fight in\nboth rain and smoke!\n\nImmerse yourself in the fully interactive game environment, in\nwhich you can ram pretty much everything with your tank.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c1d990d3046183938e7af8e48404cae23e2899d","amp;dn":"Tank+Combat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c1d990d3046183938e7af8e48404cae23e2899d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,29,153,13,48,70,24,57,56,231,175,142,72,64,76,174,35,226,137,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
